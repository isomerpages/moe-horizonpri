### **Homework Policy**

At Horizon Primary School, we give due consideration to how much time is appropriate for students to complete their homework at each level, according to their aptitude.

The responsibilities of each Horizon student include the following:

1. Listen to homework instructions in class.
2. Copy down instructions for the task and deadline date into the organiser.
3. Ensure that homework is completed and handed in to meet the deadline.
4. Attempt all work and give his/her best.
5. Inform the subject teacher of any difficulties

Our schoolâ€™s recommendations are as follows:-

1. Minimal or no homework will be assigned to students on Wednesdays due to the extended
    school hours till 3.30p.m.
2. The approximate time allocation during school term per day / week and holidays are stipulated
    in the table below.
