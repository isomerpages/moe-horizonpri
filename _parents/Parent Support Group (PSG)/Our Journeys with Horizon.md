It took me a lot of courage to join PC! as I was worried that I might not have the time, I could not contribute effectively or the expectations would be too high.

However, I was proven wrong. Being a part of PC! was such an enriching experience. The synergy and support in the team were excellent. I realised my worries were unfounded.

When we plan activities, we are guided by this principle, "Everything that we do is for the kids". This has allowed us to work closely with the school to organise fun-filled activities for the children.
