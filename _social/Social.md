### **Social**
Horizon Primary School develops our students in the social domain by equipping them with social skills and honing their ability to interact socially with others. In addition, students are taught about their roles in society as well as Singaporeâ€™s place in the world to strengthen the Singapore Spirit in our students. Through CCAs, for example the Scouts, our students learn to interact and socialise with others. The infusion of National Education in the school curriculum and the Internationalisation@Horizon programme provides our students with a deeper knowledge of and fosters a greater sense of belonging to Singapore.

Some of the school programmes that support the development of the social domain include:
