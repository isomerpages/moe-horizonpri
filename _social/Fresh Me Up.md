### **Fresh Me Up**
Fresh Me Up is Horizon’s Values in Action (VIA) programme in which our students learn to be leaders by taking charge of the school environment and making a difference through their actions. &nbsp;Our students from We-Care club would educate their peers about the right way to maintain the restrooms and ensure that they are functional and user friendly. The students beautify the restroom environment through designing posters to remind users of good restroom etiquette. On top of these responsibilities, they learn to inform the school of any repairs or maintenance that are necessary in the restrooms.

Horizon Primary School has been awarded the Platinum STAR award in 2019 after receiving the GOLD award for 3 consecutive years. It is an award given out by the Restroom Association (Singapore) in recognition to the school’s holistic approach in highlighting that toilets need to be treated as quality restrooms so as to sustain hygiene and social etiquette.&nbsp;

The school's Fresh Me Up programme was featured on the&nbsp;[MOE SchoolBag website](https://www.schoolbag.sg/story/bringing-out-the-leader-in-every-child?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=e-mail&amp;utm_campaign=2017-april).
