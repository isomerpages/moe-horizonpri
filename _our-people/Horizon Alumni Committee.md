<h4><strong>About The Logo:</strong></h4>
<p>We, the alumni committee, have created this icon whereby we chose to use
the school’s mascot, the “geese” to represent the alumni members. Firstly,
there are twelve geese, this represents the core alumni committee as there
are twelve of us. Geese are migratory birds that fly across countries for
warmth. When they fly, they form a “V” shape. It allows them to fly faster
compared to flying alone. This shows that teamwork allows us to progress
faster and at a more efficient pace. When a goose is tired, it will fly
to the back to the formation and let another goose lead the way.</p>
<p>This shows that all of us are leaders and capable of leading one another.
It also depicts that we are strong and united, as well as a humble team
as we know when to let others have their turns to lead. We learn from others
to improve ourselves. Geese also honk from behind to encourage those who
are flying in front and when a goose falls behind, two other geese will
accompany it till it catches up with the rest. This shows that we care
and show compassion towards one another. It also tells others that we would
always be willing to give anyone a helping hand.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the icon shows that we are all strong individuals with
leadership qualities as well as a harmonious team that will love to help
others out and listen to one and another’s advice. Hence, we chose the
geese to be part of this icon.</p>
<p>Next, the colour of the bird: red, purple, yellow and blue. These colours
stand for the houses: Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence respectively.
This gives others the message that they should expect these values in us.
Last but not least, the school logo along with the word “Horizon Alumni”
is to show that we are still part of Horizon Primary School.</p>

<h4><strong>Words From The People In The Alumni Committee:</strong></h4>
<p>What inspired me to come back to Horizon Primary School was not only the
opportunity to give back to the school, but also the prospect of being
able to work together with all other alumni. In addition to our shared
experience in this primary school, we have all also grown to be our own
person in further institutions, so I thought it might be worth discovering
what a group of people with similar yet contrasting experiences might be
able to create together. The older ones share their reliable and consistent
insights and experience, while the younger ones brainstorm up bolder ideas
to push our committee to newer heights as well as enhance the benefits
received by our juniors whom we are supporting in all ways. In retrospect,
indeed, I was proven right!&nbsp;
<br><strong>- Olivia [Secretary]</strong>
</p>
<p>Joining the committee was my way of giving back to the six memorable years
that I had spent in Horizon. It was a way of keeping in touch with friends
and teachers who have shaped me, a chance to connect with the future students
of Horizon and provide some novel insights for the post-primary route and
to nurture my leadership and organisation capabilities. I'm excited to
see not only the future of Horizon and all of the alumni who continue to
make an impact but also the multiple opportunities the current committee
can provide for current students to better help them shape their future!</p>
<p><strong>- Shyanne [Treasurer]</strong>
</p>
<p>For me personally, I decided to join the committee as I wanted to give
back to the school that has given me so much during my 6 years there and
has taught me values and habits that I still practice to this day. Being
on the committee so far has allowed me to develop my leadership and planning
competency while allowing me to reconnect with my friends and ex-teachers
from the school with whom I have shared very dear childhood memories. Looking
towards the future, I hope that we, the Alumni committee,&nbsp; will be
able to bring back more Alumni to reconnect with their friends, ex-teachers,
and the school and encourage them to give back to the school!
<br><strong>- Jedidiah [Vice Chairperson]</strong>
</p>
<p>Originally, I joined this committee to better myself through the numerous
opportunities and experiences provided. The 6 years I have had studying
in Horizon motivated me to join this committee in order to express my gratitude
while giving back to my juniors. The years I have spent working with the
teachers and the rest of the committee to establish connections within
the alumni have taught me many valuable skills and it has been a truly
memorable experience. Hence, I've decided to continue my work as the chairperson
with the additional desire to provide support in nurturing the next batch
of leaders in this committee. Overall, I hope to give the current students
and past batches the platform they need to network and bond after graduation.
