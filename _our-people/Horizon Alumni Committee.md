#### **About The Logo:**
We, the alumni committee, have created this icon whereby we chose to use the school’s mascot, the “geese” to represent the alumni members. Firstly, there are twelve geese, this represents the core alumni committee as there are twelve of us. Geese are migratory birds that fly across countries for warmth. When they fly, they form a “V” shape. It allows them to fly faster compared to flying alone. This shows that teamwork allows us to progress faster and at a more efficient pace. When a goose is tired, it will fly to the back to the formation and let another goose lead the way.

This shows that all of us are leaders and capable of leading one another. It also depicts that we are strong and united, as well as a humble team as we know when to let others have their turns to lead. We learn from others to improve ourselves. Geese also honk from behind to encourage those who are flying in front and when a goose falls behind, two other geese will accompany it till it catches up with the rest. This shows that we care and show compassion towards one another. It also tells others that we would always be willing to give anyone a helping hand.  

In conclusion, the icon shows that we are all strong individuals with leadership qualities as well as a harmonious team that will love to help others out and listen to one and another’s advice. Hence, we chose the geese to be part of this icon.

Next, the colour of the bird: red, purple, yellow and blue. These colours stand for the houses: Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence respectively. This gives others the message that they should expect these values in us. Last but not least, the school logo along with the word “Horizon Alumni” is to show that we are still part of Horizon Primary School.

#### **Words From The People In The Alumni Committee:**
The reason I joined the committee is that I wanted to continue to develop my leadership skills and hope to give back to the school. I feel that Horizon Primary holds a lot of great memories I made with friends and the teachers, and I wanted to give others more great memories of Horizon Primary school.<br>
**\-Celine \[Secretary\]**

I wanted to join this committee as I think it is a good way to gain experience. Plus, I like giving back to the school so it is a win-win situation.<br>
**\-Kyra \[Treasurer\]**

I join the committee as it is a good opportunity to develop my leadership and responsibility; and an opportunity to repay the school for accompanying me on my journey for 6 years. Horizon Primary School is a great school that focuses on the values of the students and provides multiple opportunities for the students to flourish. I hope by joining this committee, i can help the alumni to reconnect with the school, to reconnect with one's roots.<br>
**\-Aaron \[Vice Chairperson\]**

To all teachers, I am grateful for their time and sacrifices. I was once a playful student but after 6 years of nurturing, care, concern and most importantly, love from the teachers, I have changed a lot. I feel bad for what I had done in the past and I want to be able to help my school and show others that I also care and show love to people around me. To ex-students of Horizon Primary, I would like to bring all of us back together. I want us to be forever united as a big family and reignite our wonderful memories of childhood in the school. To future alumni, I wish you all the best in your future, but always make some time to visit your teachers and friends from Horizon. As the alumni chairperson, our team will do our best to bring teachers and alumni together to ignite their childhood memories again and again and again.<br>
**\- Yifeng \[Chairperson\]**
