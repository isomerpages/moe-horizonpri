### **Write@Horizon**
At Horizon, we believe that every child can write. We develop our students so that they become writers with a voice, able to express their ideas freely and creatively. We urge them to seek inspiration from their personal experiences and tell stories about the people they have met, places they have been and things they have done.   

To do this, our teachers design termly writing packages that enable students to be skilled writers. Through this in-house writing programme, students learn how to plan and develop creative and interesting storylines through a range of planning tools. They learn to apply their grammar skills to express their ideas coherently and meaningfully. Students are also taught to pepper their stories with idioms, humour and irony.   

Through our yearly publications, we encourage our students’ efforts in writing by recognising their pieces of work.
