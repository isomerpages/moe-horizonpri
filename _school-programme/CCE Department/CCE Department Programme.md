<p><strong>ECG @ Horizon</strong>
</p>
<p>In Horizon Primary School, students are given opportunities to learn about
educational pathways beyond primary schools. This is done through various
platforms:</p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SkillsFuture Portal Lessons</strong>
<br>During these lessons, students explore the portal to find out about educational
pathways available. With this information, students can better decide on
the paths they want to pursue.</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECG Bazaar</strong>
</p>
<p>Booths manned by student representatives of different secondary schools
to showcase their schools’ events and programmes are put up to provide
students with enriching experiences to find out more about their next phase
in their educational pathway.</p>
