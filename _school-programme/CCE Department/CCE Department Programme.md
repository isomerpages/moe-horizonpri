<p>The School Captains showed appreciation to the transport frontliners of
Punggol MRT / LRT Station with notes and tokens of appreciation during
the SBS Transit Kindness Month. The Cub Scouts CCA helped to pack Chinese
New Year goodie bags while our staff collaborated to deliver them to our
community partners, sending warm wishes to people around us. The projects
allow students and staff to demonstrate the sense of respect and compassion
to the community.</p>
