<h3><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong></h3>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the
necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each
key education stage for successful transition from school to further education
or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning
throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and
qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to
prepare students for the 21st Century.</p>
<p><strong>Goals of ECG</strong>
</p>
<p>The goals of ECG are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</ul>
<p><strong>ECG @ Horizon</strong>
</p>
<p>In Horizon Primary School, students are given opportunities to learn about
educational pathways beyond primary schools. This is done through various
platforms:</p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SkillsFuture Portal Lessons</strong>
<br>During these lessons, students explore the portal to find out about educational
pathways available. With this information, students can better decide on
the paths they want to pursue.</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECG Bazaar</strong>
</p>
<p>Booths manned by student representatives of different secondary schools
to showcase their schools’ events and programmes are put up to provide
students with enriching experiences to find out more about their next phase
in their educational pathway.</p>
<h3><strong>National Education</strong></h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education are one entity since values and character
are the basis to become responsible citizens. &nbsp;In line with the 21st
Century Competencies Framework, we aim to nurture students with sound values
and competencies, so that they can strive towards being self-directed learners,
concerned citizens, active contributors and confident persons</p>
<p>Each year, schools commemorate 4 significant events to reinforce the importance
of citizenship education, namely&nbsp;Total Defence Day,&nbsp;International
Friendship Day,&nbsp;Racial Harmony Day and&nbsp;National Day. At Horizon,
we enrich the learning experiences of our students by engaging them in
pre-assembly programme, assembly programmes, through lessons in Character
and Citizenship Education and activities co-designed with National Education
Captains that are customised to enrich their learning. These programmes
aim to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values</strong>&nbsp;to
understand Singapore’s history, realities and challenges unique to our
nation, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for
survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be empowering and aspirational</strong>&nbsp;allowing for individual
sense-making, so as to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware,
adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional, and global
issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help our students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans</strong>&nbsp;and
foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope which motivates our
students to play a contributory role in their immediate communities and
in the nation while they seek to achieve their personal life goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Total Defence Day</strong></h4>
<p>Schools commemorate Total Defence Day (TDD) on 15 February each year to
mark the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD,
our students reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore’s
best all-round response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore(e.g.
terrorism, pandemics,cyber-attacks, influence campaigns or economic crises).
Students also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six pillars of
Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social
Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core
message of every Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to
protect Singapore and our shared way of life.</p>
<h4><strong>International Friendship Day</strong></h4>
<p>Schools commemorate International Friendship Day on the 3rd Friday of
Term 2. This is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore’s relations
with neighbouring countries and beyond. The commemoration of IFD allows
our students to be sensitised to Singapore’s geopolitical realities, and
to reflect on the importance of</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>an active foreign policy to maintain Singapore’s international space;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>openness to the international flow of trade, ideas and talent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cross-cultural skills and a global orientation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the spirit of friendship and collaboration amongst different people.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an island nation amongst many other nations, Singapore must take cognisance
of the importance of relating well with nations near and far. Together,
we can promote economic growth, social progress, sociocultural evolution
while protecting regional peace and stability.</p>
<h4><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong></h4>
<p>Preserving the harmony of races and religion is important to Singapore.
&nbsp;Singapore has come a long way from tolerating differences to celebrating
diversity. Commemorated on 21 July each year, we aim to instill in our
students this mutual respect and understanding that they will have for
the different races.</p>
<p>Schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on 21 July each year to mark
the anniversary of the 1964 race riots. On this day, students reflect on
and celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity
of cultures and the collaborative effort of all to promote social cohesion.</p>
<h4><strong>National Day</strong></h4>
<p>National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence
as an independent country in a community of nations. The school-based commemoration
brings to students a sense of the historical importance and solemnity of
National Day. At Horizon, we celebrate National Day by starting off the
day with the observance and flag raising ceremony, whereby our national
flag is led into the ceremony by members of the Cub Scouts CCA. Through
the Recollection ceremony, we hope to remind ourselves of our country’s
struggles during the early days, as well as the resilience of our people
as they synergise to overcome challenges and to develop their beliefs that
Singapore can continue to progress and achieve greater heights. Through
All Children Exercise Simultaneously workout and the National Day concert,
we demonstrate our unity through our body movements and voices.</p>
