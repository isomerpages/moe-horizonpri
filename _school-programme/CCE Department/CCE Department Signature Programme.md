<h4><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong></h4>
<p>Values in Action is the basis of developing our students as socially responsible
citizens. This is achieved through their ownership to the community they
live in. At Horizon, VIA is made actionable through I-LEAD+ and various
programmes. Students are provided with enriched learning experiences to
encourage them to continue making a difference to others’ lives and make
our home, Singapore, a better place to live in. As leaders for others,
they put into practice how they can impact the home, school and community
through their 6 years of journey in Horizon.</p>

<p>Students learn about the different traditional games seen in Singapore.
By seeking first to understand, students discuss and select a game, then
put themselves in the shoes of the players and design rules, posters, etc
with the aim of teaching their peers and others how to play the game at
a school event where their friends from all levels come together. On the
actual day, students set up booths, teach and encourage others to play
together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Building on what the students have learnt in Primary 5, they now
apply technology to further contribute to meet the needs of the underprivileged
families in the Punggol Community. Students will understand how Singapore
makes use of technology to overcome constraints and continue to aim to
be self sufficient in growing our own vegetables. Students will have hands-on
experience of planting and harvesting the vegetables, and presenting them
to the underprivileged families. 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies such
as Cross Cultural Literacy, Civic Literacy, Critical and Inventive Thinking
will be further enhanced and developed through this project.</p>
