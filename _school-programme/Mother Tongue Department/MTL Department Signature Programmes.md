<h4><strong>MTL Fortnight!</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight</strong> is a key initiative
by the Ministry of Education (MOE) aimed at sparking students' interest
in learning their Mother Tongue Languages through engaging and creative
activities. It also strives to cultivate an immersive environment for students
to explore and appreciate their linguistic and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>During these two dynamic weeks, students will engage in various interactive
activities, including traditional arts and crafts, that provide authentic
opportunities to use their MTL. These activities are carefully designed
to emphasize the development of <strong>cross-cultural skills</strong> and <strong>communication skills</strong>,
empowering students to navigate and thrive in a multicultural and interconnected
world.</p>
<p>By participating in these activities, students strengthen their cultural
identity, enhance their connection to their heritage, and gain a better
understanding of their role within their cultural community. Through meaningful
interactions, they also build confidence in using their Mother Tongue to
express themselves effectively and foster mutual understanding across cultures.</p>
<p>These experiences help students deepen their understanding of cultural
traditions and foster the core competencies of collaboration, communication,
and cross-cultural skills. The MTL Fortnight ultimately supports MOEâ€™s
mission to nurture future-ready learners who value their roots while embracing
diversity.</p>
