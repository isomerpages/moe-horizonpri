<h4><strong>Reading</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture a love for reading in Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), we incorporate
structured reading time into the curriculum. Through this, we aim to cultivate
studentsâ€™ <strong>Respect</strong> for cultural roots, <strong>Integrity</strong> in
learning, <strong>Compassion</strong> in understanding diverse perspectives,
and <strong>Excellence</strong> as bilingual readers.</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 and 2 students participate in the <strong>MTL SOAR</strong> programme,
designed to <strong>Spark</strong> interest, <strong>Open</strong> minds, <strong>Appreciate</strong> cultural
heritage, and <strong>Rise</strong> as confident readers.</p>
<p>During these sessions, teachers engage students with age-appropriate texts,
creating meaningful opportunities to explore stories, deepen their understanding
of language, and develop essential 21st-century competencies such as civic
literacy, communication and critical thinking.</p>

<h4><strong>Festive Celebrations</strong></h4>
<p>We celebrate Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, and Deepavali annually to help
students understand and appreciate the richness of their cultural heritage.
Beyond school-based festivities, we bring students into the community during
these celebrations, providing them with opportunities to share the joy
of the season, give back to society, and embody values such as Respect
and Compassion.</p>
<p>By participating in these celebrations, students not only deepen their
understanding of their own culture but also gain a greater appreciation
for the traditions of others. This fosters mutual respect, strengthens
community bonds, and promotes harmony within our diverse society.</p>
