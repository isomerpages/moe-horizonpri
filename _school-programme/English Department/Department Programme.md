<h4><strong>ReadLit@Horizon</strong></h4>
<p>Our in-house literature programme aims to further develop a sense of passion
and appreciation for the English Language. Our teachers design lessons
that teach our students to develop critical thinking and learn to analyse
the world that we live in with an open mind. Over their years in Horizon
Primary, our students study a variety of texts.</p>
<p>They will struggle with Mowgli about his identity, sit in a giant peach
with James, win a golden ticket to the chocolate factory and sing to the
dawn with&nbsp;Dawan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kwai. Through these stories and various
fun activities specially tailored to the interests of our students, we
teach them to make connections and interact closely with the texts. Together
with their classmates, they gain deeper insights of their lives and are
hence better equipped to make meaning of the world that they are growing
up in.</p>
<p>Every year, we launch our publication series titled ‘The Books We Read.’
Each year, different cohorts of students get to showcase what they had
learnt and done during their&nbsp;literature lessons. Students are always
proud and happy to receive the publication as they can reminisce what they
had created that year with their&nbsp;friends. Parents are also delighted
to see their children in action.</p>

<h4><strong>Write@Horizon</strong></h4>
<p>At Horizon, we believe that every child can write. We develop our students
so that they become writers with a voice, able to express their ideas freely
and creatively. We urge them to seek inspiration from their personal experiences
and tell stories about the people they have met, places they have been
and things they have done.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this, our teachers design termly writing packages that enable students
to be skilled writers. Through this in-house writing programme, students
learn how to plan and develop creative and interesting storylines through
a range of planning tools. They learn to apply their grammar skills to
express their ideas coherently and meaningfully. Students are also taught
to pepper their stories with idioms, humour and irony. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our yearly publications, we encourage our students’ efforts in
writing by recognising their pieces of work.</p>
