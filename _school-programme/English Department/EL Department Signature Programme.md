<h4><strong>EL Fiesta</strong></h4>
<p>EL&nbsp;Fiesta is specially designed to allow students to showcase what
they have learnt in their literature texts. It&nbsp;allows&nbsp;us to explore
the books that we have read. Through this programme, we gain a deeper understanding
of each story and get to learn English Language in more interesting ways!</p>
<p>Each&nbsp;year,&nbsp;the students&nbsp;read a different&nbsp;book. Teachers&nbsp;carry
out&nbsp;various customised&nbsp;activities in class that provide opportunities
for&nbsp;them&nbsp;to engage with the book or discuss about&nbsp;it with
their classmates. Some&nbsp;of the activities&nbsp;include&nbsp;writing
a letter to the author or a character,&nbsp;drawing&nbsp;favourite scenes
from the book and even&nbsp;creating their very own word&nbsp;search puzzles!&nbsp;The
students’ work is later published in our yearly magazine, ‘The Books We
Read’, celebrating and outlining our memorable journey with the books during
the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;magazine captures the students’ learning
experiences during&nbsp;ReadLit@Horizon&nbsp;lesson.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;hope that our students will carry on their love for literature
and produce creative works of their own!</p>
