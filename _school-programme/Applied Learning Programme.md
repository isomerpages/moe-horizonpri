<h1><strong>Applied Learning Programme</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>STEMpowered Innovations</strong></h2>
<p>Our school’s ALP has been refreshed from Computational Thinking in Mathematics
(CTIM) to STEMpowered Innovations. This revised direction provides students
with richer opportunities to explore Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM), while developing essential 21st Century Competencies
such as collaboration, critical and inventive thinking, adaptability and
communication skills.</p>
<p>Through STEMpowered Innovations, students learn to apply technology meaningfully
to solve real-world problems. There are two tiers of development to provide
differentiated opportunities for students.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Tier 1</u></strong></h4>
<p>Primary 3: Students experience coding through purposeful play using different
platforms. We empower students to choose projects they are passionate about
and to develop solutions through coding, using platforms that suit their
interests and readiness.</p>
<p>Primary 4: Students deepen their learning through Interdisciplinary Project
Work (IPW), integrating STEM ideas across subject areas in collaborative
problem-solving.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Tier 2</u></strong></h4>
<p>Primary 4 to 6 Star Coders: Students with strong interest and aptitude
are invited to take on advanced challenges to deepen their learning and
expand their exploration in STEM and coding.</p>
<p>Our ALP nurtures our students to be Inventive Thinkers, Purpose-driven
Reflectors, Effective and Empathetic Communicators, Civic Literates and
Digital Literates, equipping them to contribute confidently and responsibly
in a fast-changing world.</p>
