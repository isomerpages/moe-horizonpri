<h4><strong>Computational Thinking In Mathematics - Horizon Primary School's Applied Learning Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Learning mathematics is a key fundamental in every education system that
aims to prepare its citizens for a productive life in the 21st century.
As a nation, the development of a highly-skilled and well-educated manpower
is critical to support an innovation- and technology-driven economy. At
Horizon Primary School, Computational Thinking in Mathematics enables students
to develop computational thinking skills, acquire collaborative skills
and dispositions such as confidence and resilience through age-appropriate
coding lessons. These are important 21st century competencies that we want
students to develop during their primary school years.</p>

<h5><strong>Computational Thinking In Mathematics Framework</strong></h5>
<p>The Computational Thinking in Mathematics framework sets the direction
for the development of computational thinking pedagogy and curriculum.
The ‘heart’ of the Computational Thinking in Mathematics is to enable students
to become critical thinkers who are effective and efficient problem-solvers.
The three inter-related components of the framework are curriculum, attitudes
and resources. Encompassing these components are computational thinking
skills and 21st century competencies that we must imbue in our students,
so that they will become engaged, life-long learners who are future ready.</p>

<h5><strong>Computational Thinking In Mathematics Curriculum</strong></h5>
<p>The Computational Thinking in Mathematics curriculum integrates and aligns
coding and protyping activities to the Mathematics curriculum to help students
reinforce Mathematical-thinking skills through computational thinking processes.
At the end of each year, students would have learned to code a microprocessor
called Micro:bit using a web-based software, Makecode.org. Purposeful age-appropriate
opportunities are provided for real-life application of learning. This
allows students to make meaningful connections across various disciplines.</p>
<p>Most importantly, through the learning experiences of Computational Thinking
in Mathematics, students become more confident and show greater resilience
in persisting to solve Mathematical and task-based problems. They embrace
a growth mindset, “Try Fail Try” to code and prototype the product.</p>
