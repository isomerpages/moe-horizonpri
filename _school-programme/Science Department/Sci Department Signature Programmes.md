<h4><strong>Empowering Sustainability Through ER3</strong></h4>
<p>The Ever Ready to Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle (ER3) programme at Horizon
Primary School inspires students to take ownership of sustainable practices
and integrate them into their daily lives. Through initiatives such as
recycling drives, upcycling workshops, and eco-trails, students develop
the core value of Respect for the environment and gain a deeper appreciation
of their role as stewards of the Earth. The hands-on activities encourage
students to think critically about conservation and adopt actionable habits
that contribute to a sustainable school and community.</p>
<p>ER3 emphasises on empowering students to spearhead sustainability efforts
within and beyond the school. Student leaders are given opportunities to
plan and lead initiatives such as waste reduction campaigns and resource
conservation projects, fostering Integrity as they act with responsibility
and consistency in their advocacy. These roles also nurture Compassion,
as students inspire their peers to consider the impact of their actions
on the environment and the lives of others.</p>

<h4><strong>Developing Confident Problem Solvers</strong></h4>
<p>In Horizon Primary School, we seek to inspire curiosity, creativity, and
critical thinking in our students through the power of STEMâ€”Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics in our Science curriculum. STEM encourages
problem-solving, collaboration, and communication, helping our students
to explore the world around them while developing essential skills for
the future.</p>
<p>By incorporating STEM into our curriculum, we also allow students to learn
by connecting ideas and concepts across different disciplines and giving
them time to integrate ideas from different perspectives and consider alternative
ways of building knowledge as we empower them to become innovators, leaders,
and critical thinkers of tomorrow.</p>
