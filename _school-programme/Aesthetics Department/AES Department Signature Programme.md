<h3><strong>Viva La Musica</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Viva La Musica (VLM) For P1 and P2</strong></h4>
<p>Viva La Musica (VLM) means “long live music”! And long it shall live every
year, our Primary 1 and 2 students showcase their experiential learning
through play during Viva la Musica. This showcase marks a milestone in
their learning and an opportunity for them to develop a deeper relationship
with the arts. It is a platform to build their confidence as they present
and perform their musical items, as well as communicate to make meaning
of their artworks and performances, and connections to our society and
culture.</p>
<p>In 2021, during the Primary 2 VLM, we have 2 pre-event segments: the art
photo challenge and the special music performance. The students voted for
the most creative photo with concentric shapes in their own classes. Special
performances by our talented students and their families were also selected
to be featured for Viva la Musica. Do view the videos below to find out
more about this annual event!</p>
