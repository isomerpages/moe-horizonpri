<h4><strong>P6 Exhibition Module</strong></h4>
<p>Art lends itself naturally to exhibition and publication, which serves
as the final communicative stage and is an important part of the student
artist learning cycle. Aligning with the MOE art syllabus, the exhibition
core module is implemented on our curriculum, whereby our Primary 6 students'
artistic creations are showcased in a school wide platform and not limited
to the classroom. The aim is to provide all students an authentic artistic
learning experience as both an artist and an audience.</p>
<p>Primary 6 students will embark on an introspective art making process-
exploration of art mediums, theme development and art critique using the
MTV routines, across 2 terms to create an artwork they envisioned. This
learning platform projects all voices from our Primary 6 students through
their creative expressions where they are exposed to various art processes
and practices that go beyond conventional art forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this simulated environment of a museum space surrounded by authentic
artworks, it aims to heighten students' curiosity and engagement with the
world they live in. This access to the art exhibition space ensures maximum
participation by students from all levels to build on their cognitive,
social, artistic and creative thinking skills when they engage with the
artworks through meaningful MTV art discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the final curated art exhibition space, all students and staff in
Horizon Primary have the opportunity to experience Horizon’s inaugural
art exhibition first-hand to appreciate the artistic development and creative
expressions of our Primary 6 students.</p>

<h4><strong>e-ART Publication</strong></h4>
<p>Like every exhibition in a museum/ gallery, a catalogue is made available
to bring over the visual content and nature of the subject of the exhibition.
An artwork exhibited is not going to be a permanent display unlike an authentic
published catalogue- a permanent possession proof of the artwork being
captured and recognised in print.</p>
<p>Our e-art publication aims to feature not only the final artworks showcased
in the exhibition, but also the process that demonstrates the students’
creative thinking and exploration leading up to their final artworks. Not
only will it serve as a momento to celebrate the students’ creativity and
a platform of recognition, it also serves as a learning resource for the
students to discover the many various ways that their peers have thought
and explored in the art making process.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;<strong>P4 Museum Based Learning</strong></h4>
<p>As part of a refreshed art education syllabus aimed at making learning
more authentic and for exposure to Singaporean art, students will have
the opportunity to visit museums (e.g. the National Gallery Singapore).
In addition, a recommended list of artworks by local and international
artists has also been included in the new art syllabus so that pupils can
develop an awareness of Singaporean art. Through these authentic learning
opportunities, students get to familiarise themselves with the artworks
that depict different themes such as landscapes, portraits and history.</p>

<h4><strong>Making Thinking Visible (MTV) In Aesthetics Lessons</strong></h4>
<p><strong>“Making students thinking visible serves a broader educational goal as well. When we demystify the thinking and learning process, we provide models for students of what it means to engage with ideas, to think, and to learn.”</strong>&nbsp;Ron
Ritchhart</p>
<p>MTV routines encourage our students to think further than what they see,
be curious by posing critical questions, respect different points of views
and gain new insights. MTV routines are well-infused in our art and music
lessons to engage the students’ minds to encourage critical thinking and
active thought processing in order to deepen their content knowledge. Some
examples of MTV routines are,&nbsp;<em>“What makes you say that?”, “Compare and Contrast”, Connect, Extend, Challenge” and “Think, Puzzle, Explore”</em>.
These simple routines are well ingrained in our students, such that they
begin to use the language without prompting. They start to notice something
unfamiliar and wonder about it. They make their thinking visible which
makes it available for exploration, reflection and growth.</p>

<h4><strong>Music Lessons</strong></h4>
<p>Music making is an enjoyable experience for all our students. During music
lessons, the students experience different music making through music exploration,
music composition and creativity. To make our students’ music making visible,
we use MTV routines to allow students to be creative and expressive while
allowing multiple interpretations and connections to develop their thinking.</p>
<h4><strong>Art Lessons</strong></h4>
<p>Apart from art making, our students learn about the context of artists
and art history through observation of artworks in order to engage them
in meaningful learning. Students are presented with artworks for them to
analyse by picking visual clues from the artworks. After that, they interpret
the artworks by applying the knowledge they have learnt. They discuss with
their peers and share various perspectives.&nbsp;With the use of MTV routines
in art lessons, it creates a comprehensive and enriching art learning experience
for the students.</p>

<h4><strong>Playing The Ukelele</strong></h4>
<p>The ukulele is a very versatile and portable instrument that has grown
in popularity over the past few years. It is a great choice for our P3
and P4 students to pick up this simple instrument with only four strings.
They start off with the basics of understanding the instrument which includes
knowing its different parts, playing posture, fingering on the strings
and more. By learning a variety of playing techniques, it will allow the
students to play songs of different genres, whether solo or as an ensemble.
Students learn how to sing and play on the ukulele by focusing on the coordination
between their playing and singing. We hope that this provides our students
with the opportunity to further their musical interests and enjoyment in
future.</p>
