<h4><strong>Scouts</strong></h4>
<p>Scouts CCA aims to build and develop studentsâ€™ leadership skills and confidence,
their sense of adventure and outdoor skills, empowering them to make positive
contributions to the school and society through a range of exciting activities,
such as campfires and hiking.</p>
<p>The Cub Scouts also develop the abilities to recognise the strengths,
needs and values of others in different settings and learn to respect others
and appreciate diversity in collaborative learning environments.</p>
<p>During scouting activities, the Cub Scouts are given opportunities to
experience responsible decision making, goal setting and organisational
skills.</p>
<p>With the acquisition of the new knowledge and skills, the Cub Scouts become
more confident and competent to lead their peers in activities that benefit
and grow the cubs progressively and holistically.</p>
