<h4><strong>P4 Outdoor Education Day Trip: Exploring Oasis Terrace and Punggol Waterway Park</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our Physical Education curriculum, our Primary 4 students embarked
on an exciting Outdoor Education Day Trip to Oasis Terrace and Punggol
Waterway Park. This adventure provides a unique opportunity for students
to apply their classroom learning in an authentic outdoor setting.</p>
<p>The day trip is designed to expand the context of learning beyond school
grounds, allowing students to discover the green spaces in our neighbourhood.
By exploring Oasis Terrace and Punggol Waterway Park, students deepen their
personal connections with the local environment and gain a greater appreciation
for nature.</p>
<p>Before the trip, students learn essential skills for safe outdoor exploration.
They practice observing their surroundings carefully and using their senses
to stay present and focused. These preparatory lessons ensure that students
are ready to make the most of their outdoor experience.</p>
<p>During the trip, students put their outdoor education theory knowledge
into practice. Armed with their PE Journals, they embarked on various activities
that encourage active learning and discovery. Facilitated by their PE teachers,
the students created experience maps as they observe unique plant life,
and learnt interesting facts about their neighbourhood. These hands-on
experiences help students develop problem-solving and decision-making skills,
fostering their spirit of adventure and resilience.</p>
<p>The day trip also emphasises personal responsibility and independence.
Students learn the importance of packing appropriately for outdoor activities,
including bringing healthy snacks and water. They practice maintaining
personal hygiene in an outdoor setting, understanding its significance
for their well-being and the environment.</p>
<p>This outdoor learning journey serves as a stepping stone for future adventures,
particularly the 3-Day 2-Night camp in Primary 5. It allows students to
apply place-responsive skills and gain confidence in navigating outdoor
environments safely and meaningfully.</p>
<p>Through this experience, our P4 students not only connect with nature
but also learn valuable life skills. They discover the consequences of
their actions on themselves, others, and the environment, fostering a sense
of responsibility and environmental awareness.</p>
<p>The P4 Outdoor Education Day Trip to Oasis Terrace and Punggol Waterway
Park is more than just a field trip â€“ it's an opportunity for growth, discovery,
and fun. It exemplifies our commitment to holistic education, providing
students with a big classroom full of wonder and endless lessons waiting
to be learned.</p>
