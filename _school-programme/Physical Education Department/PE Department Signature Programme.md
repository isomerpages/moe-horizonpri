<h4><strong>P4 Outdoor Education Day Trip: Exploring Oasis Terrace and Punggol Waterway Park</strong></h4>
<p>As part of our Physical Education curriculum, our Primary 4 students embarked
on an exciting Outdoor Education Day Trip to Oasis Terrace and Punggol
Waterway Park. This adventure provides a unique opportunity for students
to apply their classroom learning in an authentic outdoor setting.</p>
<p>The day trip is designed to expand the context of learning beyond school
grounds, allowing students to discover the green spaces in our neighbourhood.
By exploring Oasis Terrace and Punggol Waterway Park, students deepen their
personal connections with the local environment and gain a greater appreciation
for nature.</p>
<p>Before the trip, students learn essential skills for safe outdoor exploration.
They practice observing their surroundings carefully and using their senses
to stay present and focused. These preparatory lessons ensure that students
are ready to make the most of their outdoor experience.</p>
<p>During the trip, students put their outdoor education theory knowledge
into practice. Armed with their PE Journals, they embarked on various activities
that encourage active learning and discovery. Facilitated by their PE teachers,
the students created experience maps as they observe unique plant life,
and learnt interesting facts about their neighbourhood. These hands-on
experiences help students develop problem-solving and decision-making skills,
fostering their spirit of adventure and resilience.</p>
<p>The day trip also emphasises personal responsibility and independence.
Students learn the importance of packing appropriately for outdoor activities,
including bringing healthy snacks and water. They practice maintaining
personal hygiene in an outdoor setting, understanding its significance
for their well-being and the environment.</p>
<p>This outdoor learning journey serves as a stepping stone for future adventures,
particularly the 3-Day 2-Night camp in Primary 5. It allows students to
apply place-responsive skills and gain confidence in navigating outdoor
environments safely and meaningfully.</p>
<p>Through this experience, our P4 students not only connect with nature
but also learn valuable life skills. They discover the consequences of
their actions on themselves, others, and the environment, fostering a sense
of responsibility and environmental awareness.</p>
<p>The P4 Outdoor Education Day Trip to Oasis Terrace and Punggol Waterway
Park is more than just a field trip – it's an opportunity for growth, discovery,
and fun. It exemplifies our commitment to holistic education, providing
students with a big classroom full of wonder and endless lessons waiting
to be learned.</p>

<h4>Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp: Dare to Dream</h4>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Each year, our Primary 5 students embark on an exciting journey to develop
essential life and outdoor skills through Outdoor Education in Physical
Education. With the theme Dare to Dream, the Outdoor Adventure Camp aims
to instill important values such as resilience and respect while fostering
strong teacher-student relationships. Throughout the camp, students also
cultivate independence and confidence as they put into practice the school-wide
7 Habits.</p>
<p><strong><u>Pre-Camp Experience</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Beginning with the End in Mind, the Camp Commandant as well as the vendor
conducted a comprehensive briefing for all Primary 5 students. They were
briefed on several matters ranging from the objectives of the camp to safety
matters to expected activities. Students were also advised on the packing
list.</p>
<p>To ignite enthusiasm and drum up excitement, the PE and Art Departments
collaborated in organising a Camp T-shirt Design Competition. Here students
creatively expressed their vision of the camp. The winning design was proudly
printed on the camp T-shirts, giving students a sense of ownership and
anticipation for the adventure ahead.</p>
<p><strong><u>3D2N Outdoor Adventure Camp Experience: Dare to Dream 2024</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Urban and rural landscapes blended together to form the backdrop for 2024's
3days 2nights P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp at the Singapore Discovery Centre.
Campers rotated through several activities ranging from outdoor cooking
to tent pitching to rafting. These outdoor experiences provided the students
with opportunities to build resilience and confidence. Despite initial
discomforts, the P5s rose to the occasion, challenging themselves to embrace
the new rigour, away from the comforts of home! The warmth from the shared
excitement, friendly rivalry, good-natured banter besides camaraderie were
the memorable and cherished moments the P5s treasured as they broke camp.
With cheers still ringing in their ears, they bid a fond adieu to the campsite,
leaving on a high note, having enjoyed their time away from home.</p>
<p><strong><u>Post-Camp Experience</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Collaborating with the English and ICT Departments</p>
<p>The adventure didn’t end when the camp concluded. Students captured their
experiences through a post-camp reflection writing assignment, leveraging
their ICT skills by collaborating on Google Slides to document their learning.</p>
<p>Student-Led Conference Sharing</p>
<p>At the Student-Led Conference, students proudly presented their reflections
to their parents, sharing their growth and memorable moments with confidence
and joy.</p>
<p>All in all, the Dare to Dream camp was a truly enriching and transformative
experience, creating lasting memories and valuable lessons for our Primary
5 students at Horizon Primary School!</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Junior Olympic Games (JOG)</h4>
<p>An integral part of the Horizon experience, the Junior Olympic Games (JOG)
is a highly anticipated event held in conjunction with the Children’s Day
celebrations. This exciting event is designed to encourage students' active
participation in a diverse range of activities that contribute to their
physical, cognitive, and social development. It also serves as a platform
for students to exemplify the core values of Excellence, Friendship, and
Respect, fostering a spirit of sportsmanship and teamwork.
<br>
<br>During JOG, students engage in a wide variety of games and activities,
from thrilling bouncy castles to inclusive Paralympic-inspired games and
traditional carnival-style challenges. These fun-filled experiences not
only provide students with an opportunity to test their skills but also
help strengthen camaraderie among peers. With the end goal in mind, students
collaborate and strategize with their housemates to earn as many points
as possible, all striving to emerge victorious as the Champion House!
<br>
<br>One of the most anticipated highlights of the event is the Torch Relay,
a symbolic tradition that unites the entire school community. The torch
is passed from students to school staff, then to parents, and finally to
our esteemed Principal, Mrs. Ong, who officially declares the opening of
JOG, marking the beginning of an exhilarating day of celebration.
<br>
<br>Beyond participating in games, JOG also provides students with meaningful
opportunities to develop leadership skills and contribute to their school
community. Selected student groups take on active roles in organizing and
managing various game stations, including running the Primary 4 Values-in-Action
(VIA) games, showcasing their dedication to service and teamwork.
<br>
<br>Through JOG, Horizon students not only enjoy a memorable and joyous celebration
but also gain invaluable experiences in collaboration, leadership, and
sportsmanship—truly embodying the spirit of the Junior Olympic Games!</p>
