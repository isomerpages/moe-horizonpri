<h4><strong>P3 and P4 SwimSafer</strong></h4>
<p>At Horizon, students learn swimming at P3 as part of the PE Curriculum
through the SwimSafer Programme. SwimSafer is a national initiative designed
to teach students swimming skills and water survival techniques. The programme
helps students build confidence and become more independent in the water.
In addition, it promotes proactiveness and responsibility as students prepare
for their SwimSafer lessons by organising their bags and preparing for
their SwimSafer lessons.</p>
