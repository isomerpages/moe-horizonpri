<h4><strong>Wushu </strong></h4>
<p>Wushu CCA provides students with the opportunity to develop strength,
flexibility and balance through the individual Wushu techniques. Some of
the basic moves include having a firm stance and executing controlled punches,
kicks and jumps which require full body awareness and coordination. Through
the sessions, students have the opportunities to learn basic and intermediate
fist and weapon routines.</p>
<p>Training sessions in Wushu instill the values of discipline and excellence,
and allow students to practise 7 Habits. Students develop social awareness
by synergising as a team, recognising and accepting differences in others
and helping others to achieve success. Self-management skills are also
groomed as they learn to manage their emotions and overcome physical and
mental obstacles.</p>
<p>In striving for sporting excellence, students aspire to represent the
school in the annual National Primary Schools Wushu Championships!</p>
