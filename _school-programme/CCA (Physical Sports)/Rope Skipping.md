<h4>Rope Skipping</h4>
<p>Rope skipping at Horizon offers students a unique opportunity to develop
their skills. Through this CCA, students build physical strength, cardiovascular
fitness, agility, and resilience.
<br>
<br>Beyond physical benefits, rope skipping helps students cultivate essential
life skills, including self-confidence, self-discipline, and creativity.
As they master various routines, students learn valuable lessons in teamwork,
synergy, and sportsmanship, forging strong bonds with peers from their
own class and school.
<br>
<br>Most importantly, rope skipping lays the foundation for a lifelong commitment
to healthy living, empowering students to unlock their potential, shine,
and excel in their own unique ways.</p>
