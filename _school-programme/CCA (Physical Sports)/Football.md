<h4><strong>Football</strong></h4>
<p>Football is a sport which requires players to have strong character, encompassing
perseverance, determination, discipline, resilience and teamwork. In Horizon,
we aim to develop the passion for football in our young players with the
guidance and expertise of our dedicated and experienced coaches and teachers.</p>
<p>Our Football CCA not only focuses on the honing of technical skills of
our players, such as dribbling, passing and tackling, but also the development
of values such as respect and integrity towards their opponents and teammates
alike. We aim to develop our students into responsible self-leaders and
active contributors to society.</p>
