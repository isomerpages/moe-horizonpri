<h3><strong>Swimming</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>SwimSafer (PE Curriculum)</strong></h4>
<p>Students in Horizon will be introduced to Swimming at Primary 3 through
the SwimSafer Programme as part of the PE Curriculum. SwimSafer is a national
water safety programme which aims to teach students swimming proficiency
and water survival skills. It helps students to gain confidence and develop
independence in the water. Through the programme, students will also learn
to be responsible and independent by packing their bags and preparing for
their SwimSafer lessons.</p>
<h4><strong>Swimming CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Students have the opportunity to extend their love and passion for swimming
through the Swimming CCA. The Swimming CCA envisions to develop studentsâ€™
character and values through the sport. Students will take charge of their
learning and strive for excellence by building on their swimming proficiency.
In pursuing sporting excellence, students have the opportunity to participate
in the annual National Primary Schools Swimming Championships! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the opportunities to improve their fitness and refine swimming
techniques, Swimming CCA aims to nurture our students to be dedicated and
resilient leaders in all aspects of&nbsp;life.</p>
