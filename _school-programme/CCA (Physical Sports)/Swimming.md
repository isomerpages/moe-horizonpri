<h3><strong>Swimming</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>SwimSafer (PE Curriculum)</strong></h4>
<p>Students in Horizon will be introduced to Swimming at Primary 3 through
the SwimSafer Programme as part of the PE Curriculum. SwimSafer is a national
water safety programme which aims to teach students swimming proficiency
and water survival skills. It helps students to gain confidence and develop
independence in the water. Through the programme, students will also learn
to be responsible and independent by packing their bags and preparing for
their SwimSafer lessons.</p>
