<h4><strong>Modern Dance</strong></h4>
<p>The Modern Dance CCA at Horizon is an exciting, vibrant and engaging program
designed for students to explore the art of movement and rhythm in a fun,
dynamic way. Students can express themselves through dance while developing
their creativity, coordination and physical fitness.</p>
<p>Our CCA allows students to experiment with various dance styles, including
contemporary, jazz, hip-hop, and more, enabling them to discover their
unique movement language. The program is designed to be inclusive, ensuring
that every child, regardless of their prior experience or skill level,
feels confident and capable in expressing themselves.</p>
<p>Students can look forward to participate in competitions and performances
such as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), Chinese Street Dance Competition
and Star Awards.</p>
