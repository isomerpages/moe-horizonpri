<h4><strong>Guitar Ensemble</strong></h4>
<p>“Music is life. That’s why our hearts have beats.” – Anonymous</p>
<p>Our Guitar Ensemble believes in music’s power to connect, inspire, and
shape us. We help our students develop their skills, confidence, and artistic
expression, nurturing them into competent musicians with a lifelong passion
for the arts. Students explore a variety of musical genres, from popular
hits to classical pieces, while expanding their knowledge of music reading,
chords, and playing techniques. Through ensemble practice, they learn to
harmonise and perform beautifully as a team.</p>
<p>Our ensemble fosters teamwork, respect, and resilience. Students learn
to listen, balance sounds, and support one another, even when facing challenges,
especially if they are new to the instrument. Their dedication drives them
toward excellence, whether performing at school events like the Star Awards
Ceremony or at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. Through
this CCA, students not only gain musical skills but also develop essential
21st-century competencies, including confidence, adaptive thinking, creative
expression, and cultural appreciation. Our ensemble broadens their understanding
of music’s role in diverse cultures and contexts.</p>
<p>Our Guitar Ensemble strives to develop the musical abilities of our students,
form lasting friendships, and enable students to express themselves through
music. We create music that resonates!</p>
