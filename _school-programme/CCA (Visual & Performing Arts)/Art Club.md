<p>The Art Club CCA takes a student-centric approach, focusing on exploration
of different art media and forms, creation of artworks and appreciation
for ideas, concepts and communication. Students acquire the knowledge and
skills in art making and are encouraged to use their imagination to infuse
real life experiences into their 2D and 3D artworks using mixed media.</p>
<p>Students with higher-level art skills are identified to be in our Advanced
Art Group, offering them a chance to further develop their abilities beyond
the standard Art Club CCA curriculum. This specialised focus encourages
this group of students to refine their craft and explore more advanced
techniques, pushing their artistic potential to new heights.</p>
<p>In addition, the Art Club seeks to cultivate values of respect and excellence
in students. They are given the opportunities to develop their Social Emotional
Competency in collaborative work and to become self-directed and confident
learners.</p>
