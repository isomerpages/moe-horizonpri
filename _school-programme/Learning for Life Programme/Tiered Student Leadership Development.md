<h3><strong>Tiered Student Leadership Development</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Tier 1 - Everyone is a Leader</strong></h4>
<p>At this tier, every student is given a class leadership role. Form Teachers,
together with subject teachers, evaluate their student’s leadership potential
by using the Personal Qualities (PQ), Supporting the students’ leadership
development through the three levels of leadership:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Level 1:&nbsp; Self-leader</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level 2:&nbsp; Responsible Leader</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level 3:&nbsp; Respected leader</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Developing every student to be a leader who is confident and self-directed
in learning is our school’s key focus. At Horizon Primary School, the Personal
Qualities for Holistic Development Profile of our student are based on
the 7 Habits.</p>
<h4><strong>Tier 2 - Student Leaders for the Student Community</strong></h4>
<p>Students who have displayed positive leadership qualities may be identified
to be student leaders within the student community. These student leaders
undergo several trainings in 7 Habits<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;and leadership
skills before embarking on their leadership journeys. These are the groups
of students who can lead their peers and be entrusted with greater responsibilities.
Tier 2 Student leaders in Horizon Primary are the drivers to engage the
student population and to seek students’ voice.</p>
