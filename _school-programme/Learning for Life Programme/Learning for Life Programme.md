<p>Horizon Primary is committed to nurture every child to lead their lives
responsibly and to contribute with joy.&nbsp;A whole-school Student Leadership
Development Programme through CCE, I-LEAD is Horizon’s flagship programme
since 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I-LEAD is developed with the vision that our students can be empowered
to become effective self-leaders. Our students will have the capacity to
lead their own lives and be able to influence and contribute to those around
them positively. Horizon Primary believes that Every Child is a Leader.</p>
<p>Horizon’s I-LEAD curriculum is developed by the school and is anchored
upon the school’s core values (Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence
– R.I.C.E) and guided by Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits&nbsp;of Highly Effective
People ®.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;7 Habits is used as a tool for developing self-leadership in
our students.</p>

</div>
<p>As Horizon grows, the practice of the 7 Habits&nbsp;is integrated into
various platforms. This allows our students to internalise and demonstrate
the 7 Habits&nbsp;through their daily learning experiences.</p>
<p>I-LEAD+ is our renewed I-LEAD curriculum in 2019. I-LEAD+ serves as the
backbone to the school’s CCE Curriculum, with the students experiencing
a holistic education through three main focus areas; Life Skills (Leadership),
Social Emotional Competencies and Values and Citizenship Education. In
I-LEAD+, the 7 Habits&nbsp;remain as the common strand that permeates through
our instructional programmes.</p>

<p>I-LEAD+ curriculum involves both explicit and integrated teaching of 7
Habits. Primary 1 and Primary 2 students undergo ‘Discovering the Leader
in Me’ lessons through weekly designated 7 Habits periods. Primary 3 to
Primary 6 students continue to learn the 7 Habits via integration in the
different subjects/domains.</p>
<p>These subjects/domains include:</p>
