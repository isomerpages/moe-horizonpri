<h4><strong>Infocomm Club</strong></h4>
<p>The Infocomm Club aims to equip students with essential digital skills
by focusing on Coding and New Media technologies. Through hands-on learning,
students will develop computational thinking, problem-solving abilities,
and creativity in coding. They will also explore New Media technologies,
including digital content creation, video production, and multimedia design,
to enhance their storytelling and communication skills. By fostering innovation
and collaboration, the club prepares students for the evolving digital
landscape, empowering them to become confident and responsible technology
users. We uphold our integrity by coming up with original and creative
digital projects.</p>
<p>Students who are talented in the field and consistently display the right
attitudes have the opportunity to take part in a variety of Infocomm related
competitions held throughout the year. The following are the annual competitions
we take part in, not including other adhoc competitions:</p>
<p>• School Digital Media Awards (SDMA)</p>
<p>• National Infocomm League (NIL)</p>
<p>• National Primary Games Creation Competition (NPGCC)</p>
