<h4>International Chess Club</h4>
<p>The International Chess Club CCA aims to develop the studentsâ€™ analytical
and thinking skills to solve problems on the fly. One of the benefits of
playing chess includes developing brain functions, improving memory as
well as cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>Through the CCA sessions, students learn to put first things first by
strategising and visualising their moves. As students train and practice,
they develop the skills of forming tactics, seizing opportunities to win
and evaluating their games at the end of the match. They will also display
school values such as respect and integrity when playing a match against
their opponents.</p>
<p>In striving for excellence, students will have the opportunity to represent
the school and pit their wits against others in the annual National Schools
Chess Championships!</p>
