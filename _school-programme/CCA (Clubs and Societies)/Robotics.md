<h4>Robotics</h4>
<p>The Robotics Club is a vibrant and engaging CCA for students who are passionate
about technology, engineering, and innovation. Merging Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), robots provide an excellent platform
for the development of emerging 21st century competencies such as critical,
adaptive and inventive thinking as well as effective communication and
collaboration among team members. The activities provide a hands-on learning
environment where members can explore the exciting world of physics and
mechanics through a progressive curriculum during the years in the club,
where current content builds on previous knowledge to mould the young minds
into confident and effective problem-solvers.</p>
<p>With a strong belief in learning by doing, students develop essential
skills in engineering, coding, and problem-solving as they expand their
understanding of the mechanics of robot movement. Members also get to hone
their logical thinking ability as they learn to design and programme their
robots through block-based programming, strengthening their analytical
and creative learning skills. Through active engagement in the problem-solving
process of the tasks assigned, they work together in a team and develop
team spirit and leadership through the activities planned.</p>
<p>Our involvement in national robotics competitions provides a platform
for members, who display talent in their craft, to showcase their work
and gain valuable experience. We are proud of our members' efforts and
excellent achievements in recent competitions such as the National Robotics
&amp; Programming Competition, Innovation, Design and Engineering Series
and World Robot Olympiad Nationals.</p>
