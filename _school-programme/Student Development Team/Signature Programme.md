<h4><strong>Study Skills and Motivation Programme for P5 and P6</strong></h4>
<p>The Study Skills and Motivation Programme is a 2-year programme organised
by the Student Development Team (SDT) for our Primary 5 and Primary 6 students.
The programme aims to develop our students in three key areas&nbsp;as they
prepare for their milestone examination and progress to the next phase
of their educational journey in the secondary schools. Here are the three
key areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Self-Motivation</strong>
<br>- To boost students’ self-confidence and guiding students in developing
a positive mindset in achieving personal goals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Study Skills</strong>
<br>- To understand their own learning styles, and to harness the strength
of their learning style and attributes to their own learning.</p>
<p><strong>3. Social Emotional Development and Empathy for Others</strong>
<br>- To understand the importance of self-discipline and ownership of their
learning; and
<br>- To recognise and reflect on the impact and consequences of one’s actions
and decisions on self and others.</p>
