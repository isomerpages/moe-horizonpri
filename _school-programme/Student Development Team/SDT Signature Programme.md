<p>This program is designed to inspire purposeful lives in our students by
partnering with stakeholders. Together, we'll embark on a journey to nurture
curiosity, resilience, and community engagement in our young learners.
Our students learn to be resilience from these experiences. They will be
able to connect their passions with meaning goals and such exposure is
very good for their insights of the world.</p>
<h4><strong>How program works?</strong></h4>
<p>Parents volunteer your time, share your personal stories on how you face
the challenges and inspire our students to explore and find meaning in
their pursuits. This simple yet powerful process allows us to tap into
the wealth of experiences within our parent community. Your stories and
insights will provide invaluable real-world context to our students' learning
journey.</p>
