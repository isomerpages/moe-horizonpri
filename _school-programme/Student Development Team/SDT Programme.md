<h4><strong>SafePlay@Recess</strong></h4>
<p>SafePlay@Recess is a specially designed programme that encourages students
to engage in meaningful play during recess while fostering friendships
and teamwork. Through a variety of activity stations, such as Explorations
Stations, Leaders’ Hub, Courtyard, Field, and Playground, students have
the opportunity to learn, collaborate, and have fun beyond their classrooms.</p>
<p>More than just play, SafePlay@Recess nurtures the <strong>joy of learning</strong> while
reinforcing important values and leadership skills. Students <strong>practise the 7 Habits</strong>,
learn to <strong>synergise with their peers</strong> and develop essential
social skills such as <strong>relationship management</strong>, showing <strong>Respect, Integrity, and Compassion</strong>,
while striving for <strong>Excellence</strong> in all they do.</p>
<p>By providing a safe and structured environment for play, SafePlay@Recess
helps students build <strong>communication and collaboration skills</strong>,
form stronger connections with their peers, and grow into confident and
responsible <strong>leaders</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong>Study Skills and Motivation Programme for P5 and P6</strong></h4>
<p>The Study Skills and Motivation Programme is a 2-year programme organised
by the Student Development Team (SDT) for our Primary 5 and Primary 6 students.
The programme aims to develop our students in three key areas&nbsp;as they
prepare for their milestone examination and progress to the next phase
of their educational journey in the secondary schools. Here are the three
key areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Self-Motivation</strong>
<br>- To boost students’ self-confidence and guiding students in developing
a positive mindset in achieving personal goals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Study Skills</strong>
<br>- To understand their own learning styles, and to harness the strength
of their learning style and attributes to their own learning.</p>
<p><strong>3. Social Emotional Development and Empathy for Others</strong>
<br>- To understand the importance of self-discipline and ownership of their
learning; and
<br>- To recognise and reflect on the impact and consequences of one’s actions
and decisions on self and others.</p>
