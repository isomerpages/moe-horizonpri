<h4><strong>SafePlay@Recess</strong></h4>
<p>SafePlay@Recess is a specially designed programme that encourages students
to engage in meaningful play during recess while fostering friendships
and teamwork. Through a variety of activity stations, such as Explorations
Stations, Leaders’ Hub, Courtyard, Field, and Playground, students have
the opportunity to learn, collaborate, and have fun beyond their classrooms.</p>
<p>More than just play, SafePlay@Recess nurtures the <strong>joy of learning</strong> while
reinforcing important values and leadership skills. Students <strong>practise the 7 Habits</strong>,
learn to <strong>synergise with their peers</strong> and develop essential
social skills such as <strong>relationship management</strong>, showing <strong>Respect, Integrity, and Compassion</strong>,
while striving for <strong>Excellence</strong> in all they do.</p>
<p>By providing a safe and structured environment for play, SafePlay@Recess
helps students build <strong>communication and collaboration skills</strong>,
form stronger connections with their peers, and grow into confident and
responsible <strong>leaders</strong>.</p>

<h4><strong>Project LOVE for P5 and P6</strong></h4>
<p>Project LOVE (Listening Openly, Valuing Emotions) is an initiative by
the SDT to facilitate better understanding of our students’ well-being
needs and emergent concerns through focused conversations. The conversation
also hopes to understand the challenges faced by the children given their
pre-teen phase.</p>
<p>Through an intimate touch point with the cohort, the SDT hopes to touch
upon the following areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Student Motivation</strong>
<br>- To understand deeply what motivates them to give their best, not just
in learning, to whatever they undertake. With that understanding, we hope
to be able to maximise their potential.</p>
<p><strong>2. Joyful Learning Experiences and Environment</strong>
<br>- To understand how pre-teens are learning now, what are some key influences
that they have and how joyful learning is like to them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Challenges and Coping Strategies</strong>
<br>- To understand what the pre-teens are struggling with, and what do they
perceive as stressors in their lives. Most importantly, we would also want
to understand the strategies which they employ to help them cope with these
stressors.</p>
<p>With insights gleaned from these conversations, it would then inform us
better of the effectiveness of our student engagement strategies in the
classroom as well as at the school level.</p>
<h4><strong>Study Skills and Motivation Programme for P5 and P6</strong></h4>
<p>The Study Skills and Motivation Programme is a 2-year programme organised
by the Student Development Team (SDT) for our Primary 5 and Primary 6 students.
The programme aims to develop our students in three key areas&nbsp;as they
prepare for their milestone examination and progress to the next phase
of their educational journey in the secondary schools. Here are the three
key areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Self-Motivation</strong>
<br>- To boost students’ self-confidence and guiding students in developing
a positive mindset in achieving personal goals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Study Skills</strong>
<br>- To understand their own learning styles, and to harness the strength
of their learning style and attributes to their own learning.</p>
<p><strong>3. Social Emotional Development and Empathy for Others</strong>
<br>- To understand the importance of self-discipline and ownership of their
learning; and
<br>- To recognise and reflect on the impact and consequences of one’s actions
and decisions on self and others.</p>
