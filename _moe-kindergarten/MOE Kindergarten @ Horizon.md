### **MOE Kindergarten @ Horizon**
MOE Kindergarten @ Horizon (MK@Horizon) received our first batch of Kindergarten 1 students in January 2020.

Horizon Primary partners MK@Horizon closely in enriching our students, both from the primary section and the kindergarten children, with learning experiences and inculcating the joy of learning as they come together during certain school celebrations and events. MK@Horizon also provides Kindergarten Care (KCare) service for students enrolled in our MK.   

We will furnish updates and information on our MK@Horizon and KCare service on this online platform.  For more information on MK, you may wish to visit [www.moe.gov.sg/moekindergarten](http://www.moe.gov.sg/moekindergarten).
