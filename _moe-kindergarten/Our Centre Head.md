### **Our Centre Head**

My personal philosophy is that every child has a voice and they deserve to be heard. I follow the child’s lead as I believe that they need to explore, discover and construct their own learning and understanding.  As an educator, I provide guidance to facilitate and scaffold our children’s learning. As a leader, it is my responsibility to create a learning environment that is enriched with age-appropriate resources and, together with my passionate and dedicated teachers, we encourage and facilitate the children to try out new ideas, problem solve and seek for possible solutions.  

During my 15 years of working experience, I had the opportunity to present at the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) Conference in 2014 on an Inquiry Practitioner Project and was awarded the ECDA Scholarship for the Bachelor Degree in Early Childhood Education with Management in 2011. This learning and professional development enable me to lead my team with confidence. Together with my team, we provide quality teaching and learning practices and experiences.

My team and I are truly committed to the children’s learning and development. We strongly believe that our children will be able to grow and develop well with the quality curriculum that we provide in MK@Horizon.
