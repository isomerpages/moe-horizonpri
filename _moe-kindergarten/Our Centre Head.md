<h3><strong>Our Centre Head</strong></h3>
<p>I am pleased to introduce myself as the Centre Head for MOE Kindergarten
@ Horizon. It is with great enthusiasm and a deep sense of responsibility
that I serve in this role, bringing with me extensive experience and an
unwavering commitment to early childhood education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Over the past five years, I had the privilege of serving as Centre
Head at MOE Kindergarten @ Tampines, where I witnessed firsthand the remarkable
growth and development that occurs when children are provided with nurturing
guidance and quality educational experiences. Prior to my tenure at Tampines,
I spent ten years managing a preschool, which provided me with a comprehensive
foundation in understanding the diverse needs, learning styles, and developmental
milestones of young children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Throughout my career, my personal belief has remained steadfast:
every child shall have the opportunities to develop their full potential
through purposeful learning experiences. I am deeply committed to ensuring
that each child in our care receives individualised attention and support
that recognises their unique strengths, interests, and developmental journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I strongly believe that children's character development is equally
important as their learning progress, focusing on nurturing them as future
citizens who demonstrate genuine care and respect towards others, understand
their responsibilities within their family, school, and broader community,
and approach everything they do with honesty and integrity. These foundational
values prepare children to become compassionate leaders, thoughtful decision-makers,
and positive influences in their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My hope is to create a truly conducive environment in our school
that supports every child's holistic development. I am excited about the
opportunity to work alongside our dedicated team of educators and in close
partnership with our families to ensure that MOE Kindergarten @ Horizon
continues to be a place where children thrive in their learning and development
and grow into confident, caring, and capable individuals.</p>
