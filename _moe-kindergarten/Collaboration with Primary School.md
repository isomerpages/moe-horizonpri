<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Collaboration with Primary School</strong></h4>
<p>At MK@Horizon, we collaborate closely with primary schools to give our
children a glimpse into primary school life. Through initiatives such as
classroom experiences, school tours, and interactive sessions, we familiarize
them with the new environment. We also invite primary school students to
visit our kindergarten and share their experiences with our MK children.
These collaborations provide valuable insights and support their transition,
ensuring our children feel confident and excited about their next leap
of learning, paving the way for a strong start in their educational journey.</p>
