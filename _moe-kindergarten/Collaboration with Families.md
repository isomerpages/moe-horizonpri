<h4>Collaboration with Families</h4>
<p>Families play an important role in nurturing childrenâ€™s holistic development.
At MK@Horizon, we collaborate closely with families for various centre
events, workshops, and special projects like the Weeks of Wonder (WoW)
project. Parents actively participate by sharing their skills, cultural
knowledge, and experiences, enriching children's learning in meaningful
ways. Involving themselves during festive celebrations, conducting storytelling
sessions, or assisting in classroom activities, their participation strengthens
the home-school partnership. This collaboration creates a supportive and
engaging learning environment that benefits the children's overall development.</p>
