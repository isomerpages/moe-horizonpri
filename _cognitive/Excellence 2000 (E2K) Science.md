### **Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science**
Horizon Primary School conducts the E2K Science Programme, a science enrichment programme for upper primary pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Science. It is developed by MOE and conducted by teachers in schools who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy.&nbsp;

The programme engages pupils in scientific investigations involving more advanced science concepts. It aims to foster independence in scientific inquiry in pupils and to help them to develop science process skills, as well as other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.
