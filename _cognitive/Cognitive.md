### **Cognitive**
The development of our students in the cognitive domain requires the teaching and learning of knowledge and thinking skills. At Horizon Primary School, we provide a joyful learning environment that offers students a diverse range of authentic learning experiences, challenging age-appropriate tasks as well as opportunities to cooperate and collaborate with other students. For example, the school has a Leaders’ Trail @ Horizon where students can have hands-on experiences studying the flora and fauna in the eco-garden when learning about diversity in Science. Another example is the introduction of Scratch, a block-based coding programme into the learning of “Angles” in Math to further develop students’ problem-solving skill and logical thinking.  

Some of the school programmes that support the development of the cognitive domain include:
