### **Basketball CCA**
The Basketball CCA aims to provide students with the opportunity to hone basic basketball skills, which includes various ball handling and shooting techniques. As basketball is a team sport which requires strong teamwork, our trainign sessions are with the aim to help our students develop greater understanding about their strength and weakness and foster camaraderie within the team. Our players will develop their verbal and non-verbal communication skills on the court as they practise offensive and defensive techniques during 2-v-2 or 3-v-2 games during CCA sessions.

We aim to develop the values of respect and compassion in our students as they learn to encourage and motivate each other during training sessions. Ultimately, we believe that all the students from the Basketball CCA will be exemplary in their character and be great sportsmen.
