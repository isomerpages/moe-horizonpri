### **Ever ready to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (ER3)**
To nurture our students to become self-leaders who love the environment, environmental education has been a key Science programme from the onset. &nbsp;The school environmental curriculum addresses environment protection issues as well as energy and water conservation topics. Through differentiated activities for different age groups, students have developed a deeper understanding of current environmental issues. They are able to make informed and responsible decisions in their daily activities to exhibit care for the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Active recycling and upcycling is practised in school. School-wide collection drives and whole school upcycling activities are carried out to educate and involve all students in upcycling used t-shirts, bottle caps, straws, milk cartons and banners to make useful substances. Recycling bins based on the school house values are placed at the canteen to encourage students to recycle paper or plastic.

Horizon Primary also had its first E-waste collection Drive in collaboration with StarHub and the Singapore Environment Council. E-waste such as old and disused phones, laptops, headphones and compact discs were collected from students, parents and staff who participated with much enthusiasm. More than 400 kilograms of e-waste was collected. The e-waste was then transported to an e-waste recycling facility in Tuas to be broken down in a responsible way that is harmless to the environment.

The school has been awarded the SEC-StarHub SGA Lotus Sustained Achievement Award 2015-17 and SGA Yellow Flame Award 2018-19. The School Green Awards, in collaboration with StarHub and the Singapore Environment Council recognizes the effort of schools for our continued and sustained excellent efforts in environmental education.

In 2021, the ER3 team teamed up with Books Beyond Borders, a non-profit organization to collect used story books from the students instead of them being thrown away. These books would be resold locally and the money collected used to fund educational initiatives in third world countries like Nepal. We are proud to share that we collected more than 2300 books in total! These reaffirm our schoolâ€™s aim to teach students to protect the environment and to help social causes.
