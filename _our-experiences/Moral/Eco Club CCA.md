### **Eco Club CCA**
The Eco Club is a CCA that gathers all environmental enthusiasts, inspiring individuals to take action to ensure a sustainable future.  Eco Club members are actively involved in discussing environmental matters affecting our Earth to raise members’ awareness and interest in the environment. They are empowered to make daily decisions to support a healthy and sustainable planet.

Eco Club members are committed to care for our environment through reducing, reusing and recycling the available resources. Through vegetable growing programmes and community outreach programmes, the Eco Club members serve as leaders of Environmental Education, actively taking steps towards a more sustainable tomorrow.

As part of the national movement to conserve Singapore’s natural heritage, Eco Club members are involved in the Greening Schools for Biodiversity program which serves to bring students closer to nature without leaving the school compound. Students learn to appreciate the local biodiversity and are actively involved in planting biodiversity-attracting flora to enhance the biodiversity in the school and creating a biodiversity trail to provide a guided walk for their peers.
