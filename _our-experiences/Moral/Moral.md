### **Moral**
At Horizon Primary School, we have a strong focus on developing our students in the moral domain. This involves inculcating the correct values in the students and supporting the formation of the right habits necessary for developing leaders of good character. Horizon Primary School is a Leader in Me school, where through our flagship programme ILEAD+, students learn the 7 Habit for effective leadership, that enable our students to take responsibility for leading themselves, their friends and the community.  In tandem with the ILEAD+ programme, the school provides opportunities through initiatives such as the ER3 (Ever Ready to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle), an initiative to promote care for the environment, and programmes such as the Values in Action programme for students to practise their leadership skills and demonstrate their school values.
