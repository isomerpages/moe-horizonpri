### **Values in Action (VIA)**
Values in Action is the basis of developing our students as socially responsible citizens. This is achieved through their ownership to the community they live in. At Horizon, VIA is made actionable through I-LEAD+ and various programmes. Students are provided with enriched learning experiences to encourage them to continue making a difference to others’ lives and make our home, Singapore, a better place to live in. As leaders for others, they put into practice how they can impact the home, school and community through their 6 years of journey in Horizon.
