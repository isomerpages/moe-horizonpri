Horizon Primary is committed to nurture every child to lead their lives responsibly and to contribute with joy.&nbsp;A whole-school Student Leadership Development Programme through CCE, I-LEAD is Horizon’s flagship programme since 2010.&nbsp;

I-LEAD is developed with the vision that our students can be empowered to become effective self-leaders. Our students will have the capacity to lead their own lives and be able to influence and contribute to those around them positively. Horizon Primary believes that Every Child is a Leader.

Horizon’s I-LEAD curriculum is developed by the school and is anchored upon the school’s core values (Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence – R.I.C.E) and guided by Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits&nbsp;of Highly Effective People ®.

The&nbsp;7 Habits is used as a tool for developing self-leadership in our students.

As Horizon grows, the practice of the 7 Habits&nbsp;is integrated into various platforms. This allows our students to internalise and demonstrate the 7 Habits&nbsp;through their daily learning experiences.

I-LEAD+ is our renewed I-LEAD curriculum in 2019. I-LEAD+ serves as the backbone to the school’s CCE Curriculum, with the students experiencing a holistic education through three main focus areas; Life Skills (Leadership), Social Emotional Competencies and Values and Citizenship Education. In I-LEAD+, the 7 Habits&nbsp;remain as the common strand that permeates through our instructional programmes.

I-LEAD+ curriculum involves both explicit and integrated teaching of 7 Habits. Primary 1 and Primary 2 students undergo ‘Discovering the Leader in Me’ lessons through weekly designated 7 Habits periods. Primary 3 to Primary 6 students continue to learn the 7 Habits via integration in the different subjects/domains.

These subjects/domains include:

*   Physical Education – 7 Habits Routines
*   Art &amp; Music – Making Thinking Visible (MTV) Routines
*   English Language – Read @ Horizon and Write @ Horizon
*   Social Studies – P4 Social Studies Innovation Projects
*   Values in Action (VIA)
