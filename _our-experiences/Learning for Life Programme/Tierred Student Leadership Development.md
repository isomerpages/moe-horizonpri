### **Tierred Student Leadership Development**
#### **Tier 1 - Everyone is a Leader**
At this tier, every student is given a class leadership role. Form Teachers, together with subject teachers, evaluate their student’s leadership potential by using the Personal Qualities (PQ), Supporting the students’ leadership development through the three levels of leadership:

*   Level 1:  Self-leader
*   Level 2:  Responsible Leader
*   Level 3:  Respected leader

Developing every student to be a leader who is confident and self-directed in learning is our school’s key focus. At Horizon Primary School, the Personal Qualities for Holistic Development Profile of our student are based on the 7 Habits.

#### **Tier 2 - Student Leaders for the Student Community**
Students who have displayed positive leadership qualities may be identified to be student leaders within the student community. These student leaders undergo several trainings in 7 HabitsTM and leadership skills before embarking on their leadership journeys. These are the groups of students who can lead their peers and be entrusted with greater responsibilities. Tier 2 Student leaders in Horizon Primary are the drivers to engage the student population and to seek students’ voice.
