### **Mother Tongue Language Fortnight**
Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight aims to create an immersive environment for learning and appreciating Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. Students are exposed to a wide variety of activities such as Chinese Brush Painting, Classical Malay Calligraphy, and Indian Earthen Pot Designing during these two eventful weeks, with the hope that these culturally rich activities would deepen our students' understanding of their cultural roots and promote the learning of MTL in a fun and engagement way!

MTL Fortnight is a highly anticipated event of the year for both teachers and students of Horizon Primary School.
