### **Science Discovery Day**
Science Discovery Day provides an opportunity for our students to extend their learning of Science concepts in authentic situations. They will experience Science in an exploratory manner, engage their senses in learning Science and be curious about Science.

The Science Department organised Horizon’s first Science Discovery Day in 2012, and it has been our annual tradition since then. All pupils are provided with an opportunity to experience Science resources in Horizon Primary School such as the Eco-garden and resources at the LEADers’ Hub.

Activities for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are carried out based on selected themes or topics each year. Students have fun exploring more about Matter, Plants, DNA, and Climate Change and Sustainability.
