### **Mathematics Alive!**
Math Alive! aims to promote joyful learning. It is a platform where the love for Mathematics is inculcated through fun and interactive activities such as Tangrams, Sudoku and other Math brainteasers. These activities promote Mathematical thinking and reasoning in students through games.

Apart from developing thinking skills and the love for Mathematics, students learn to work collaboratively and improve their communication skills as they solve the problems together. As students persevere in solving problems, they enact the attitude “Try Fail Try” to solve the problems successfully.
