### **In House EL Programmes**
At Horizon, our teachers nurture our students to be confident and competent users of the English Language.&nbsp;We plan a variety of activities to raise awareness and for students to recognise the importance the use of Standard English. We hope to promote the love and appreciation for the language through a myriad of fun activities.

One of the platforms we have provided students is the Spelling Bee Competition. The objective of this in house competition is to expose students to a wide range of new vocabulary and spelling strategies and compete with their peers in a fun and friendly atmosphere. We also hope to develop them so that they are able to compete at a national level!&nbsp;

Through these activities, we endeavour to inculcate a passion and appreciation of the English Language in all our students!
