### **InfoComm Club CCA**
The InfoComm Club CCA aims to excite students about Information Communication and Technology (ICT) in a fun and meaningful way by helping them to learn skills such as use of digital media, mobile technologies, software development, security and networking and games development. The club also aims to cultivate leadership and entrepreneurship capabilities at an early age. The InfoComm Club CCA leverages using the computer as a tool to aid in students' cognitive development.

Students contribute to the school by helping out in the Sound Control room and being photographers during in-house events. We uphold our integrity by coming up with original and creative digital projects.

Students take part in a variety of InfoComm related competitions held throughout the year. The following are the annual competitions we take part in, not including other adhoc competitions:

*   School Digital Media Awards (SDMA)
*   National Photography Competition
*   National Primary Games Creation Competition (NPGCC)
