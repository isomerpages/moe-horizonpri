### **Robotics Club CCA**
The Robotics Club CCA provides opportunities for students who are interested in Physics and Mechanics to pursue their passion beyond the requirements of the Primary School Science syllabus. Merging Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), robots provide an excellent platform for the development of 21st Century Skills such as innovative and critical thinking as well as effective communication and collaboration among team members.

The trainings that students undergo help them expand their understanding of the mechanics of robot movement, strengthening their analytical and creative learning skills. Students also get to hone their logical thinking ability as they learn to design and programme their robots through block-based programming. Members are actively engaged in the problem-solving process of the tasks assigned. They work together in a team and develop team spirit and decisiveness through the activities planned. 

Members who display talent in their craft have the opportunity to represent the school and participate in various competitions such as the National Robotics Programming Competition.
