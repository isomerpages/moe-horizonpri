### **International Chess Club CCA**
The International Chess Club CCA aims to develop the students’ analytical and thinking skills to solve problems on the fly. One of the benefits of playing chess includes developing brain functions, improving memory as well as cognitive abilities.

Through the CCA sessions, students learn to put first things first by strategising and visualising their moves. As students train and practice, they develop the skills of forming tactics, seizing opportunities to win and evaluating their games at the end of the match. They will also display school values such as respect and integrity when playing a match against their opponents. 

In striving for excellence, students will have the opportunity to represent the school and pit their wits against others in the annual National Schools Chess Championships!
