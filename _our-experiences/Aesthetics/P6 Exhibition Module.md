### **P6 Exhibition Module**
Art lends itself naturally to exhibition and publication, which serves as the final communicative stage and is an important part of the student artist learning cycle. Aligning with the MOE art syllabus, the exhibition core module is implemented on our curriculum, whereby our Primary 6 students' artistic creations are showcased in a school wide platform and not limited to the classroom. The aim is to provide all students an authentic artistic learning experience as both an artist and an audience.

Primary 6 students will embark on an introspective art making process- exploration of art mediums, theme development and art critique using the MTV routines, across 2 terms to create an artwork they envisioned. This learning platform projects all voices from our Primary 6 students through their creative expressions where they are exposed to various art processes and practices that go beyond conventional art forms.&nbsp;

Through this simulated environment of a museum space surrounded by authentic artworks, it aims to heighten students' curiosity and engagement with the world they live in. This access to the art exhibition space ensures maximum participation by students from all levels to build on their cognitive, social, artistic and creative thinking skills when they engage with the artworks through meaningful MTV art discussions.&nbsp;

With the final curated art exhibition space, all students and staff in Horizon Primary have the opportunity to experience Horizon’s inaugural art exhibition first-hand to appreciate the artistic development and creative expressions of our Primary 6 students.

### **e-ART Publication**
Like every exhibition in a museum/ gallery, a catalogue is made available to bring over the visual content and nature of the subject of the exhibition. An artwork exhibited is not going to be a permanent display unlike an authentic published catalogue- a permanent possession proof of the artwork being captured and recognised in print.

Our e-art publication aims to feature not only the final artworks showcased in the exhibition, but also the process that demonstrates the students’ creative thinking and exploration leading up to their final artworks. Not only will it serve as a momento to celebrate the students’ creativity and a platform of recognition, it also serves as a learning resource for the students to discover the many various ways that their peers have thought and explored in the art making process.
