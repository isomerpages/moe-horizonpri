### **Appetite For The Arts**
#### **Appetite For The Arts (AFTA)**

Appetite for the Arts (AFTA) serves as a platform for our students, by students, to whet their appetites for the Arts. The students volunteer their unique voices to be heard, be it a solo performance or as a group. These performances could vary from playing of instruments to dance, or even presenting their artworks. Through these performances and presentations, we provide learning opportunities for them to be engaged in the Arts in a more authentic context, and build their confidence in taking charge as performers and leaders. This platform also allows the creative expression of our students necessary for them to connect with one another in our ever-changing world today. Their peers learn to demonstrate proper etiquette as an audience to show appreciation for their efforts. This positive exchange between performers and audience is a win-win situation, which motivates one another to perform better and creates a joyful environment for the Arts to thrive.
