### **Art Club CCA**
The Art Club CCA takes a student-centric approach, focusing on exploration of different art media and forms, creation of artworks and appreciation for ideas, concepts and communication. Students acquire the knowledge and skills in art making and are encouraged to use their imagination to infuse real life experiences into their 2D and 3D artworks using mixed media.

In addition, the Art Club seeks to cultivate values of respect and excellence in students. They are given the opportunities to develop their Social Emotional Competency in collaborative work and to become self-directed and confident learners.
