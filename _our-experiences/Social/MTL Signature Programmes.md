### **MTL Signature Programmes**
#### **MTL Celebrate Reading!**
To ignite students’ interest in reading Mother Tongue Language (MTL) stories, students were encouraged to read stories based on various themes and complete their reading response booklets termly. The highlight of the reading programme was our MTL Celebrate Reading!. It was truly a day of fun for the students as they experienced the joy and the magic of reading!Primary 1 to Primary 3 students had opportunities to dress up as their favourite book characters by using recycled materials and take part in the best-dressed character contest. This allowed students an immersive reading experience and to connect with their favourite book characters!

Primary 4 students designed their own book covers by listening attentively to the stories read by the MTL teachers. Primary 5 students synergised to design and create posters for their favourite books, to promote the books to their fellow friends. Students admired the wonderful work produced by their peers.

Displaying the student advocacy approach, MTL Captains were also roped in to read stories in their own MT languages, and had their readings uploaded in SLS for others to view. Inspired from listening to these stories, students began to take charge of their own learning and pickup effective reading skills.

#### **Festive Celebration**
Celebrating festivals in schools have become an integral part of learning and building a strong cultural belief in a child. Horizon Primary School encourages all students to embrace other traditions and cultures just like the way they do with their own. These celebrations will bring students closer to traditional and cultural beliefs. A close bond is built among the students as they better understand one another’s unique customs. Being in a diverse country, the students need to know what each festival represents, and through the various celebrations, they will realise the rich cultural tapestry of our heritage. Having every member in the school to celebrate these occasions is always a wonderful experience for all of our staff and students.

#### **CL Cultural Programme**
Horizon Primary School has been embarking on the Chinese Cultural Awareness Programme with the intention of raising awareness of the Chinese Culture among our students. We believe that the meaningful learning experience will not only deepen our students’ understanding of their own roots but also allow them to take pride in their culture. By integrating the cultural activities into the curriculum, we hope that our students will appreciate both the Chinese Culture and the Chinese Language better. The cultural craft lessons and activities provided the Chinese students with deeper insights of the Chinese traditions, as they were introduced to the history, background and unique purposes of these crafts. We engaged our students through hands-on activities, which make learning more enjoyable and personal.
