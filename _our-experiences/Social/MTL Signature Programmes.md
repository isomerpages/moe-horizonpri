### **MTL Signature Programmes**
#### **MTL Celebrate Reading!**
To ignite studentsâ€™ interest in reading Mother Tongue Language (MTL) stories, students were encouraged to read stories based on various themes and complete their reading response booklets termly. The highlight of the reading programme was our MTL Celebrate Reading!. It was truly a day of fun for the students as they experienced the joy and the magic of reading!Primary 1 to Primary 3 students had opportunities to dress up as their favourite book characters by using recycled materials and take part in the best-dressed character contest. This allowed students an immersive reading experience and to connect with their favourite book characters!
