### **Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**
PAL is an initiative recommended by the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committee to place greater emphasis on co-curricular programmes for all Primary 1 and 2 students.

In Horizon, there are 4 domains of PAL, namely Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts and Performing Arts.

#### **PAL Modules**

| Level | Sports &amp; Games | Outdoor Education | Visual Arts | Performing Arts   |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Primary 1 | Ice Age | Nature Discoverers | Colour My World | Groovy Moves |
| Primary 2 |  | Nature Explorers | Funtastic Art | Drama RAMA |
|

PAL offers learning experiences that are fun, active, hands-on and meaningful for our students. PAL activities in Horizon are purposefully designed to allow the inculcation of values and development of studentsâ€™ social and emotional competencies. Through the activities, students learn to communicate and synergise with one another.&nbsp;
  
Collectively, PAL modules in Horizon enhance the total experience of our students to provide them with a holistic education.
