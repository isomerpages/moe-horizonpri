### **National Education**
Character and Citizenship Education are one entity since values and character are the basis to become responsible citizens. &nbsp;In line with the 21st Century Competencies Framework, we aim to nurture students with sound values, who are capable of being responsible to his family, community and nation. At Horizon, we enrich the learning experiences of our students during each of these commemoration by engaging them in pre-assembly programme, assembly programmes, through lessons in Character and Citizenship Education and activities that are customised to enrich their learning. Each year, schools commemorate 4 significant events to reinforce the importance of citizenship education, namely&nbsp;Total Defence Day,&nbsp;International Friendship Day,&nbsp;Racial Harmony Day and&nbsp;National Day.

#### **Total Defence Day**
Total Defence Day is marked annually on February 15, in Singapore to commemorate the anniversary of the surrender of the British to the Japanese on February 15, 1942, after a total of 3 years and 8 months of Japanese Occupation.&nbsp;The six aspects of Total Defence are Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, Psychological Defence and Digital Defence.

#### **International Friendship Day**
It is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore’s relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. As an island nation amongst many other nations, Singapore must take cognisance of the importance of relating well with nations near and far. Together, we can promote economic growth, social progress, sociocultural evolution while protecting regional peace and stability since. This day aims to remind our students of the importance of maintaining good relations with other nations.

#### **Racial Harmony Day**
Preserving the harmony of races and religion is important to Singapore. &nbsp;Singapore has come a long way from tolerating differences to celebrating diversity. Celebrated on 21 July each year, we aim to instil in our students this mutual respect and understanding that they will have for the different races.

#### **National Day**
National Day is celebrated every year on August 9, in commemoration of Singapore's independence from Malaysia in the year 1965. We want our students to know that while we celebrate as a nation the country’s independence, our peace, stability and prosperity should not be taken for granted. At Horizon, this day begins with the National Day Observance ceremony with our students leading in the reading of the Recollection. The celebration continues with the school singing in unison to a medley of National Day songs.
