### **Innovation Club CCA**
The Innovation Club CCA envisions to develop students into creative innovators and confident communicators of their products and ideas. In this club, students are given opportunities to be exposed to Design Thinking. Students get to create prototypes from scratch with end users in mind.&nbsp;

Through a wide array of activities, the club seeks to cultivate values of empathy, resilience and rigour. Strong camaraderie is developed as club members synergise to embrace and overcome challenges.

Innovation Club CCA aims to nurture our students into active contributors who seek to make improvements to the society.
