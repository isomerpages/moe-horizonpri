### **Internationalisation**
Every year, students of Horizon Primary School are given the opportunity to choose from trips to various destinations, such as Hong Kong, Sarawak and Xiamen as their Overseas Learning Journey.

The Internationalisation@Horizon programme aims to:

*   Develop in our students the 21st Century competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities;  
    
*   Expose students to Asia and the world and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world; and  
    
*   Deepen studentsâ€™ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.  
    
We also host visitors from overseas institutions regularly. Thus, students are also able to interact with international visitors even if they do not travel abroad.

In 2021,&nbsp;our students had the opportunity to go for a virtual immersion trip to Hong Kong. This virtual experience would offer students the next best alternative to have an internationalisation experience in light of travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the session, we had a virtual tour of historical and cultural sites in Hong Kong, watched a Cantonese Opera showcase, and worked on hands-on activities. A selected group of students also had the opportunity to interact with students from our twinning partner, The Salvation Army Lam Butt Chung Memorial School, sharing with one another the education systems (e.g. the curriculum at the primary level, as well as special programmes offered) of the respective countries, school experiences and past-times.
