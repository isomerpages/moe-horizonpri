### **Touch Science**
Touch Science provides our students with opportunities to learn Science principles and concepts using a ‘hands-on’ approach. As children are naturally curious and to make them uniquely aware of their sense of touch and sight, activities are tailored for them to physically sense through discovering interesting phenomena that range from Physical Science to Kitchen Science Chemistry.&nbsp;

Touch Science is also one of the platforms for talent and leadership development. Our Touch Science Buskers facilitate fun Science activities for their peers during recess. Touch Science Buskers also represent the school in the annual Science Buskers Festival organised by Singapore Science Centre.
