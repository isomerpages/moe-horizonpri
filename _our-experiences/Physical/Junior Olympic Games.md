### **Junior Olympic Games**
An integral part of Horizon’s experience, the Junior Olympic Games (JOG) is held as part of the Children’s Day celebrations annually. Students proactively participate in fun-filled games and sports-related activities, ranging from archery to football to traditional games. Through these activities, students sharpen their physical, cognitive and social skills as well as foster a strong sense of camaraderie amongst themselves. Beginning with the end in mind, students synergise with peers to collect as many house points as possible to excel as the Champion House!
  
In 2020, despite the challenge of a pandemic, our spirits would not be dampened and JOG advanced with several firsts!&nbsp;For the first time, K1 students from MK@Horizon joined our P.E. Captains in the Olympic Torch Relay. It was also the first time that the relay was screened live in classrooms via Zoom. An exciting start to JOG, students cheered on the P.E. Captains as they ran past the classrooms before passing the torch to our Principal, Mrs Grace Leong, who then declared the JOG open.

Besides celebrating the joyous occasion, JOG also serves as a Values-In-Action (VIA) platform for all students, staff &amp; stakeholders to show appreciation and contribute back to society. In partnership with Southeast CDC, all participants will take part in the “Walk For Rice” initiative where the total distance clocked as one Horizon family will contribute to the number of bowls of rice and oatmeal that will be disbursed to the needy families by the funding organisation. We have raised over 27,086 bowls of white rice, 27,086 bowls of brown rice and 13,543 bowls of oatmeal thus far. Through this event, students deepened their learning of the school value ‘Compassion’ and increase their awareness of how they can contribute back to society through Sports.

Indeed, Horizon students have a joyful and meaningful celebration through JOG annually!
