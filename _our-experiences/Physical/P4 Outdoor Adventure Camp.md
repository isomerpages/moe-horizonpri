### **P4 Outdoor Adventure Camp**
#### **Introduction**
Every year, our Primary 4 students are given the opportunity to learn life and outdoor living skills through Outdoor Education in Physical Education. With the theme Dare to Dream, the outdoor adventure camp aims to inculcate in our students values such as resilience and respect as well as to build teacher-student relationships. Students also learn to be independent and confident as they practise the school-wide 7 Habits throughout the camping experience.    

The design of the Outdoor Adventure Camp and the learning experiences created for our students are captured below.

##### **Pre-Camp Experience**
Beginning with the end in mind, a camp briefing was conducted for all Primary 4 students by our PE teachers.  Students were briefed on:

*   Objectives of the camp
*   Safety matters during the camp
*   Packing list
*   Expected activities during the camp
*   Pre-camp reflection

A Camp T-shirt Design Competition was held in collaboration with the Art Department, where the students expressed their creativity and what they envisioned of the camp through their design. The winning entry was selected and printed on the camp T-shirt, instilling a sense of pride and ownership for their work as they look forward to the camp.

##### **3D2N Outdoor Adventure Camp Experience: Dare to Dream 2018**
Each year, P4 students will get to apply their knowledge, skills and attitudes learnt during Outdoor Education PE lessons in an authentic context through a residential camp away from home.  This year, we had the opportunity to camp at MOE Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre (DFOALC) and learn from MOE Outdoor Adventure Educators (OAEs) as our facilitators.

##### **Key Takeaways**
The essence of the camp was brought out through the challenges experienced by the students. They forged bonds with their classmates through team building games, navigation activity, high and low elements, night walk as well as preparing their own sandwiches. Students learnt to ignite their 5 senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste) as they immerse themselves in nature.

#### **7 Habits in Action**
##### **Habit 3: Put First Things First**
Before starting the high elements activities, our students practised Habit 3: Put First Things First by ensuring that the safety harness and helmet were worn securely before embarking on play.
