### **P4 Outdoor Adventure Camp**
#### **Introduction**
Every year, our Primary 4 students are given the opportunity to learn life and outdoor living skills through Outdoor Education in Physical Education. With the theme Dare to Dream, the outdoor adventure camp aims to inculcate in our students values such as resilience and respect as well as to build teacher-student relationships. Students also learn to be independent and confident as they practise the school-wide 7 Habits throughout the camping experience.    

The design of the Outdoor Adventure Camp and the learning experiences created for our students are captured below.

#### **Pre-Camp Experience**
Beginning with the end in mind, a camp briefing was conducted for all Primary 4 students by our PE teachers.  Students were briefed on:

*   Objectives of the camp
*   Safety matters during the camp
*   Packing list
*   Expected activities during the camp
*   Pre-camp reflection

A Camp T-shirt Design Competition was held in collaboration with the Art Department, where the students expressed their creativity and what they envisioned of the camp through their design. The winning entry was selected and printed on the camp T-shirt, instilling a sense of pride and ownership for their work as they look forward to the camp.
