### **SafePlay @ Recess**
SafePlay@Recess is designed to give students a platform to engage in play activities safely during their recesses. The programme involves various games and sports activities at the various stations; such as Fitness Foyer, Explorations Stations, Leadersâ€™ Hub and Playground. Through the joy of learning with their peers out of the classroom experience, the students will also have opportunities to practise the 7 Habits. They synergise with their peers and play within their allocated space proactively. Students learn to resolve conflicts with their friends and show values such as having Respect, Integrity and Compassion for others. Last but not least, students learn to put in their best during play and achieve Excellence!
