### **Rope Skipping CCA**
Rope skipping offers students opportunities for skills development and exposure to competitive rope skipping activities on National platforms. In Horizon, Rope skipping CCA aims to strengthen students’ bodies, build cardiovascular fitness, agility and fitness. Students hone their self-confidence, self-control and creativity through the various rope skipping routines that they will learn and explore. They also learn to think win-win, synergising with others and make friends with both students in school and other schools through competitions that they participate in. Most importantly, students build a strong foundation to establish a healthy lifestyle and discover their potential as they shine and excel in their own ways.
