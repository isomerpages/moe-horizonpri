### **Badminton CCA**
The Badminton CCA provides students with the opportunity to learn the proper skills and techniques of the sport such as overhead strikes (smashes) and footwork. In pursuing sporting excellence, selected students will have the opportunity to represent the school at the annual North Zone Primary Schools Badminton Championships.
  
Students have the opportunity to display values such as Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence through the activities during CCA. They also pick up other traits such as resilience andÂ perseverance.
