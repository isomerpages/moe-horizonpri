### **Wushu CCA**
Wushu CCA provides students with the opportunity to develop strength, flexibility and balance through the individual Wushu techniques. Some of the basic moves include having a firm stance and executing controlled punches, kicks and jumps which require full body awareness and coordination. Through the sessions, students have the opportunities to learn basic and intermediate fist and weapon routines.&nbsp;

Training sessions in Wushu instill the values of discipline and excellence, and allow students to practise 7 Habits. Students develop social awareness by synergising as a team, recognising and accepting differences in others and helping others to achieve success. Self-management skills are also groomed as they learn to manage their emotions and overcome physical and mental obstacles.

In striving for sporting excellence, students aspire to represent the school in the annual National Primary Schools Wushu&nbsp;Championships!
