### **Physical**
The development of our students in the physical domain entails the teaching and learning of a broad range of motor skills that can be built upon as students grow up and take up physical activities that interest them. In addition, development in the physical domain at Horizon Primary School is also about teaching our students to make choices that will promote the development of a healthy lifestyle. The school has a range of CCAs and programmes that provide our students with opportunities to develop in the physical domain.

Some of the school programmes that support the development of the physical domain include:
