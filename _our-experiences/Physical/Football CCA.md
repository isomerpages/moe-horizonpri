Football is a sport which requires a players to have strong character , encompassing perseverance, determination, discipline, resilience and teamwork. In Horizon, we aim to develop the passion for football in our young players with the guidance and expertise of our dedicated and experienced coaches and teachers. We not only focus on developing and honing the technical skills of our players, such as dribbling, passing and tackling, but also to develop them into responsible self-leaders and an active contributors to the society.
