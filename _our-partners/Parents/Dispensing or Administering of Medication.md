### **Dispensing or Administering of Medication**
Written authorisation (by a doctor or parent) is required for dispensing and administering medication. Whenever possible, medication should be given or taken at home. Should there be a need for medication to be administered during school hours an authorisation letter with complete and clear instructions should be provided for the school to render assistance. We seek the cooperation of all parents towards the care of your children as members of the school staff are not medically trained.
