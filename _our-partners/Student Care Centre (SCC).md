### **About Raffles Student Care**
![](/images/rafflesstudentcare.png)

At Horizon Primary School, Raffles Student Care Centre is engaged to provide quality after-school student care and education for our students with close alignment to the school's strategic thrusts and directions. Raffles Student Care Centre aims to provide students with a diverse education in an environment that promotes self-discipline, character development and excellence in learning. The school care centre aligns its programmes closely with the school's Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) - I-LEAD that emphasises on student leadership through the inculcation of the 7 effective habits of leaders. As such, it nurtures cognitive growth, emotional wisdom and physical wellness in our students. With the aim to provide a holistic education to our students, Raffles Student Care Centre offers a curriculum which includes a breath of academic experience across a variety of significant areas and incorporates social, physical, emotional and more development.
