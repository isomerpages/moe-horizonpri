Undoubtedly, Horizon has played an integral part in my overall development as a citizen. Horizon has placed a lot of importance on inculcating in all of us the 7 Habits as well as the four school values (Respect, Integrity, Compassion, and Excellence) — so that we can make ethical decisions well, and still manage to make school life enriching and thrilling. I am overwhelmed with gratitude that I had the school experience with Horizon. Every day, I would wake up bright and early in anticipation of the fulfilling school day ahead, and even now in secondary school, I still have pangs of nostalgia and longing to return to Horizon and meet all my friends and teachers. I shall now expound on a few of the numerous reasons why I shall forever be indebted— in a positive way— to Horizon.

Firstly, a proud member of Horizon’s Speech and Drama Club, I can tell you with utmost certainty that my CCA definitely had a hand in whittling my public speaking skills out of what was originally a mass of apprehension and timidity. It also taught me that everyone, whether crew member or actor, plays an equally important part in the smooth running of a performance.

Secondly, in P4, I was given the rare opportunity to go for an interschool Chinese Cultural Camp at Mee Toh Primary, which strengthened my passion for my mother tongue and its rich culture; thus, boosting my interest in bilingualism and biculturalism.

Furthermore, we also had a P4 Cohort Camp which really pulled our rose-coloured glasses off as it made us realise how important self-management was and appreciate our parents in their absence. Moreover, it enabled us to forge even more wonderful memories with each other and it knitted us even more tightly together; thereby, helping to develop our social skills.

In addition, at P5, I was selected to be a Mother Tongue Programme Captain, I had a blast with my fellow captains as we attended leadership training programs together and conducted Mother Tongue Fortnight activities for the entire school. It was a wonderful experience as I got to educate others on the various cultures of other races and simultaneously hone my leadership skills and ability to work with other.

Unfortunately, my final year in Horizon arrived soon enough and all of us were stressing out over our PSLE. The COVID-19 situation did not help either; however, thankfully, our teachers knew exactly what we were going through and they came up with numerous motivational initiatives as well as extra consultation sessions as our lessons had been drastically affected by the Circuit Breaker. Even after losing count of the number of times my enunciation had to be corrected over WhatsApp and the number of grammar and Science questions I—unintentionally— flooded my teachers’ chats with, my teachers remained approachable and encouraging and they gave all my queries careful thought before answering to the best of their ability as soon as possible. After the Circuit Breaker, they even came up with engaging activities to develop our cognitive skills. Their patience and dedication to their job and us students was really heartwarming, so I know for a fact that whoever joins Horizon will be in good hands.

In a nutshell, (yes here’s a summary!) Horizon is a positive learning environment with marvelous teachers for students to learn and grow together, supporting each other all the way and forging wonderful, long-lasting bonds. I also hope Horizon will continue surpassing the school she was yesterday and being the best she can be!

One last thing for my juniors— here’s one of the major lessons I learnt from my six-year journey in Horizon (and am still learning): making mistakes is perfectly normal. Don’t beat yourself up over a blunder. Instead, focus on the fact that you know you can do it better, you know how to do it better, and you will do it better. After you have fallen down, you can cry but afterwards remember that you have to dry your tears, stand up on your own and dust yourself off before trying again. Horizon will help you every step of the way. You can do it!
