|:---:|---|
| <img src="/images/sch1.png" style="width:100%"> | We are proud to share that Horizon has received the Vanda Miss Joaquim award from the Singapore Environmental Council! This award is presented to schools that have achieved above 90% in terms of our efforts to develop environmentally friendly practices in the school and students.<br><br>In Horizon, we adopted a whole-school approach in terms of environmental education through our Ever-Ready to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (ER3) programme as well as through our departments in the curriculum. Our Go-Green Captains have also played a key role in serving as environmental stewards in advocating for the environment through various events such as the Energy Conservation Assembly Programme and the Upcycling Recess Workshop. In all, our school empowers all students to do their part for a sustainable Singapore. |

#### **2022 MOE Innergy Award**

We are proud to announce that two teams have clinched the MOE Innergy (Schools) Silver and Commendation Award in 2022 for the Innovation and English Language Department respectively.<br><br>**Design Thinking in Professional Learning Community**<br>Since 2016, Horizon Primary adopted a whole-school approach and the DuFour’s model of PLC, guided by the 3 Big Ideas and 4 Critical Questions of Student Learning. <br><br>To revolutionise teacher collaboration and achieve excellence in learner achievement, DT was infused in the implementation of PLC in 2021. Realising the power of student voice and how it enhances student volition, Professional Learning Teams (PLTs) collected empathy data, analysed them and defined the problem statement. Following that, the respective PLTs used in-house DT templates that were contextualised in our school’s PLC setting and designed teaching and learning practices that engaged students effectively. <br><br>A total of 17 DT projects were implemented in our school. 97.4% of our educators felt supported in using DT in PLC and 100% of our educators felt empowered for their professional development. Evidently, DT in PLC enhanced the professional development of our educators and the learning of our students. <br><br>**The Working OutWards (WOW) Writing Framework**<br>The objective of this endeavour was to create a composition planning framework which allowed students to write compositions fully relevant to the given topic.  In our analysis, we found that students struggled with writing compositions relevant to a given topic. Hence, the focus has predominantly been on getting students to ensure that their story is relevant to the given topic.<br><br>We attempted to innovate and break new ground by reframing how we think of Relevance. We viewed Relevance not merely as a black-or-white issue i.e. whether the storyline is relevant or irrelevant but rather on a continuum, which was a paradigm shift in thinking. We believed that students would benefit by being able to write fully relevant compositions when taught explicitly to do so. Our results show that the framework achieved its objective.

We are proud to announce that two teams have clinched the MOE Innergy (Schools) Commendation Award in 2021 for the Mathematics and Mother Tongue Languages Department respectively.<br><br>**Computational Thinking in Mathematics**<br>Computational Thinking in Mathematics (CTIM) programme is our Applied Learning Programme (ALP). CTIM is a 5-year spiral curriculum, which, exposes students to a variety of real-world problem solving experiences. Through age-appropriate coding lessons, students learn to decompose issues, make reasonable predictions, explore cause and effect and analyse the impact of their solutions. The CTIM experience enables students to develop computational thinking and; it also provides opportunities for students to practise the 7 Habits in the context of problem solving.  CTIM further teaches students to embrace a growth mindset when faced with challenges.<br><br>To adapt to the new normal, the Math Department innovates the curriculum to explore new opportunities to strengthen CTIM and the growth mindset of all stakeholders. In 2020, a framework was developed to set the direction for and provide guidance in the teaching and learning of the CTIM curriculum. We curated resources and materials to support the in-house implementation of the CTIM curriculum for primary 2 and 3 students. To overcome the challenges of conducting CTIM real-world problem solving during the pandemic, we also adopted a blended approach for the conduct of CTIM lessons with our primary 6 students.<br><br>As with all curriculum innovations, the team of Math teachers in Horizon Primary School will continue to try, fail, try as they strive to improve our customized CTIM curriculum for all Horizon Stars! <br><br> **GE.RE.K 2.0**<br>Oral communication is an important 21st century skill as effective communication skills are needed in students' daily lives. Video stimuli portray real-life situations and provide authentic contexts for oral conversation. The use of ICT creates a realistic and interactive setting that enable students to develop oral proficiency.<br><br>Our team’s project was to equip students with oracy skills through GE.RE.K 2.0 strategy with the aim that  they will be able to be confident Malay Language speakers. Flipgrid is an interactive tool that promotes joyful learning. It has helped us overcome the SMM restrictions during this pandemic and achieved our project’s objectives.<br><br>The team will continue to innovate our teaching strategies in order to produce quality teaching and learning in the Malay Language. |
