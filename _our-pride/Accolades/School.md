We are proud to share that Horizon has received the Vanda Miss Joaquim award from the Singapore Environmental Council! This award is presented to schools that have achieved above 90% in terms of our efforts to develop environmentally friendly practices in the school and students.

In Horizon, we adopted a whole-school approach in terms of environmental education through our Ever-Ready to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (ER3) programme as well as through our departments in the curriculum. Our Go-Green Captains have also played a key role in serving as environmental stewards in advocating for the environment through various events such as the Energy Conservation Assembly Programme and the Upcycling Recess Workshop. In all, our school empowers all students to do their part for a sustainable Singapore.

#### **2022 MOE Innergy Award**

MOE recognises individuals/teams, which, have successfully developed and implemented innovations that enrich students’ learning, through the MOE Innergy Awards.

**Design Thinking in Professional Learning Community**<br>
Since 2016, Horizon Primary adopted a whole-school approach and the DuFour’s model of PLC, guided by the 3 Big Ideas and 4 Critical Questions of Student Learning.

To revolutionise teacher collaboration and achieve excellence in learner achievement, DT was infused in the implementation of PLC in 2021. Realising the power of student voice and how it enhances student volition, Professional Learning Teams (PLTs) collected empathy data, analysed them and defined the problem statement. Following that, the respective PLTs used in-house DT templates that were contextualised in our school’s PLC setting and designed teaching and learning practices that engaged students effectively.  
  
A total of 17 DT projects were implemented in our school. 97.4% of our educators felt supported in using DT in PLC and 100% of our educators felt empowered for their professional development. Evidently, DT in PLC enhanced the professional development of our educators and the learning of our students.

We are proud to announce that Horizon Primary School has been awarded the Yellow Flame Award from the SEC-Starhub School Green Awards for the second consecutive year. The School Green Awards recognise the efforts put in by the teachers and students towards caring for the environment. As mentioned by PM Lee in this year's National Day Rally, climate change is one of the gravest challenges facing humankind and Singapore is feeling the impact of global warming. In Horizon Primary School, we recognize the importance of saving the Earth and have a whole-school approach to be more environmentally friendly. A highlight of our efforts this year, was the series of upcycling workshops planned and implemented by our student Eco-Leaders, heightened the awareness of our students in learning the importance of protecting our environment.
