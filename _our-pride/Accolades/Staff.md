#### **Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) 2018**
On the 18 of August 2018, the Malay Department participated in the MTLS 2018. Our department has decided to create an enriching learning experience incorporating multiple intelligences for our pupils that support written language mastery through play. Through this project, we hope to instil the love of Malay among our students by leveraging their ICT skills.

The 3D-Hive game was developed as a tool to help the pupils retain their learning of grammar components, thereby enhancing their written skills. Pupils will control the game’s avatar in a virtual kampung while embarking on various grammar quests in order to earn points. Other gameplay elements incorporated include National Education, Social and Emotional Learning and school values to infuse character development in the learning process.

The objectives of this activity are to enhance pupils’ written skills, to instil the love for Malay and to enrich and transform pupils’ learning experiences through games.

MTLS is co-organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC). Ms Low Yen Ling, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Manpower, graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour this year. A total of 18,000 visitors came to the Symposium, attended the Opening &amp; Award Ceremony and participated in a day of activities at the 43 exhibition booths, 32 sharing sessions, MTL Amphitheatre, MTL Creative Corner, and the centrepiece activity “Be a Neighbourhood Hero”.
