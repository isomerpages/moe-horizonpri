### **Viva La Musica**
#### **Viva La Musica (VLM) For P1 and P2**
Viva La Musica (VLM) means “long live music”! And long it shall live every year, our Primary 1 and 2 students showcase their experiential learning through play during Viva la Musica. This showcase marks a milestone in their learning and an opportunity for them to develop a deeper relationship with the arts. It is a platform to build their confidence as they present and perform their musical items, as well as communicate to make meaning of their artworks and performances, and connections to our society and culture.

In 2021, during the Primary 2 VLM, we have 2 pre-event segments: the art photo challenge and the special music performance. The students voted for the most creative photo with concentric shapes in their own classes. Special performances by our talented students and their families were also selected to be featured for Viva la Musica. Do view the videos below to find out more about this annual event!
