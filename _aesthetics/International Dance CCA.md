### **International Dance CCA**
The International Dance CCA aspires to groom and bring out the best in each student in the area of performing arts. Our members are exposed to different genres of dance like Ethnic Dance and Modern Dance and they are taught a carefully chosen selection of dance moves. The students are a team of driven, passionate and talented individuals who share a love for dance. They strive for the best in all their performances and dedicate our time and effort to the CCA. In time to come, we hope to become a niche area in performing arts for Horizon Primary School.&nbsp;
