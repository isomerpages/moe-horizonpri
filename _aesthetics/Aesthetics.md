### **Aesthetics**
In Horizon Primary School, we develop students aesthetically by teaching them the fundamentals of Art and Music as well as techniques that make their thinking about Art and Music visible. In addition to the Art and Music curriculum, Horizon Primary School has many opportunities for students to develop aesthetically. Programmes such as the “Appetite for the Arts” provide students with a platform to showcase their talents and perform for other students during recess.  Through CCAs, for example the Art club and International Dance club, students have opportunities to further pursue their interest in Art and Music.

Some of the school programmes that support the development of the aesthetics domain include:
