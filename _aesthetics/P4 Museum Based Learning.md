### **P4 Museum Based Learning**
#### **P4 Musem-Based Learning to National Gallery Singapore**
As part of a refreshed art education syllabus aimed at making learning more authentic and for exposure to Singaporean art, students will have the opportunity to visit museums (e.g. the National Gallery Singapore). In addition, a recommended list of artworks by local and international artists has also been included in the new art syllabus so that pupils can develop an awareness of Singaporean art. Through these authentic learning opportunities, students get to familiarise themselves with the artworks that depict different themes such as landscapes, portraits and history.
