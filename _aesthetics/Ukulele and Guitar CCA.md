### **Ukulele and Guitar CCA**
“Music is life. That’s why our hearts have beats.”&nbsp;_– Anonymous_

The Ukulele and Guitar CCA aims to develop students into confident and competent musicians who will continue to have a lifelong involvement in, and appreciation for, music. Students focus on expanding their vocabulary of chords, and strumming and plucking patterns through a diverse repertoire for performance, ranging from popular songs to classical music arranged for ukulele, guitar or both. All students learn to play their instruments – be it the ukulele, guitar or any percussion instrument – together to perform as an ensemble, to bring a beautiful piece of music to life.&nbsp;

Our CCA seeks to inculcate the values of teamwork and respect in our students. Students are provided opportunities to practise and perform with their peers. In doing so, they learn the importance of synergising and thinking win-win with one another – listening and balancing their sound – when they play their different instruments, and even sing together as an ensemble.&nbsp;As most of our students are usually new to the ukulele and guitar when they join, they practise resilience in picking up the new instrument, and put in their best effort to strive for excellence in their playing.

Besides performing in some of our school events, such as the annual Star Awards Ceremony and our 10th Anniversary Gala Dinner in 2019, other performances include the Punggol North Chinese New Year Dinner at the Punggol 21 Community Club in 2017 as well as the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in&nbsp;2018.
