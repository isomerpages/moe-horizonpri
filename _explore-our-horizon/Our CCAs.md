### **HOD's Message**
Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) form a very important and integral part of students’ learning experiences in school. Through CCAs, students will be able to discover their interests and talents. Students have the opportunity to build character, develop leadership skills and forge friendships as they deepen their passion for their CCAs. These experiences will provide them with the necessary knowledge, values and skills to achieve a holistic education.

In Horizon Primary School, we have a balanced, inclusive and diverse CCA programme that caters to a broad spectrum of interests and talents. With a range of 20 CCAs across the 4 domains of Physical Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Clubs and Societies and Uniformed Group, all P3 to P6 students will experience CCA during curriculum time. Our CCAs aim to develop students to be passionate leaders who are grounded in school values, Social Emotional and the emerging 21st Century Competencies and exhibit the 7 Habits confidently.

Each year, P2 and P3 students will have the opportunity to explore and learn about the various CCAs offered during the CCA Orientation to make informed choices. This year, we will provide students with the same opportunity via digital means. Hence, our eCCA Orientation 2020!  Through this platform, we hope parents and students will be able to view all the CCAs offered and make an informed decision before registering for the CCAs. Here’s to creating memorable experiences together in school and discovering the Joy of Learning through CCAs.
