##### **1. CCAS In Primary Schools**
**Why do we need to have CCA in Primary Schools?**<br>
*   In Primary School, students are exposed to a broad spectrum of CCAs that caters to the diverse range of interests. As they progress through the years, there will be opportunities for specialisation. 
*   CCAs allow students to discover their interests and talents.
*   CCA provides students with a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse background.

**What are the learning outcomes of CCA?**
*   Through CCA, students will be able to:<br>
\- develop passion for their CCAs/<br>
\- develop leadership skills and learn to work as a team
\- forge friendships and have a sense of belonging to the CCA and school<br>
\- ignite the spirit of service to the community<br>
\- Progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups.<br>

**How often are CCA sessions held?**<br>
*   CCA sessions are held once a week on Wednesdays from 7.45 a.m. to 9.15 a.m.
*   Additional CCA sessions may be held on Monday and/or Friday afternoons in view of competitions and/or performances for school team members. Parents will be informed prior to these additional sessions.

**Can my child/ward join 2 or more CCAs?**<br>
*   All CCA sessions are conducted concurrently, so it is unlikely for a student to have more than 1 CCA.

**Do I need to purchase equipment/ attire for specific CCAs?**<br>
*   Some CCAs may require you to purchase specific equipment/ attire for hygiene purposes (e.g. Swimming gear, Scouts Uniform, Tap Dance shoes etc.) Parents will be informed at the start of the year.

**Can my child/ward change CCA during the year?**<br>
*   Students will remain in their CCAs from P4 onwards to allow sufficient time and space for them to develop the skills and competencies related to the CCA.
*   We understand that P3 students may still be exploring their interests and as such may change CCA at the end of the year. 
*   P3 students who display great talent/passion in the identified domain/in the school team are greatly encouraged to remain in their current CCAs to further hone their skills and talents to a higher level.
