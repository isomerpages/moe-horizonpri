### **We Care Club CCA**
The We Care Club envisions to empower our students to make an impact on people and the environment. As Kindness Ambassadors, our students take action to make a difference in othersâ€™ lives.

Through a wide array of activities, the club seeks to cultivate values of compassion, empathy, responsibility and respect. Strong camaraderie will be developed as club members synergise to plan, communicate and to embrace and overcome challenges throughout the sessions.

We Care Club aims to nurture our students into active contributors who seek to make valuable improvements to the society. Using the design thinking strategy, our students create activities to promote kindness and graciousness which are both fun and meaningful. During the process, the students learn to work together and overcome challenges. They are very encouraged by the positive response from their school mates.
