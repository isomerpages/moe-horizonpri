### **EL Fiesta**
EL Fiesta is specially designed to allow students to showcase what they have learnt in their literature texts. It allows us to explore the books that we have read. Through this programme, we gain a deeper understanding of each story and get to learn English Language in more interesting ways!

Each year, the students read a different book. Teachers carry out various customised activities in class that provide opportunities for them to engage with the book or discuss about it with their classmates. Some of the activities include writing a letter to the author or a character, drawing favourite scenes from the book and even creating their very own word search puzzles! The students’ work is later published in our yearly magazine, ‘The Books We Read’, celebrating and outlining our memorable journey with the books during the year.  The magazine captures the students’ learning experiences during ReadLit@Horizon lesson.

We hope that our students will carry on their love for literature and produce creative works of their own!
