### **Leader's Trail**
Leaders’ Trail @ Horizon provides our students the opportunity to direct their own scientific inquiry either individually or in groups using the 7 Habits. Stations are set up in the Eco-garden and students who are the inquirers will explore the stations and self-assess their learning through answering the questions.&nbsp;

While going through these series of enjoyable and meaningful learning trails, students learn scientific concepts using a ‘hands-on’, ‘heads-on’ and ‘heart-on’ approach aligned to Inquiry Science Teaching. Students also develop a deeper sense of curiosity about the natural world and their surroundings based on the Primary Science syllabus. They will learn about being responsible for and caring for the environment. They will learn to be proactive, think win-win and synergise with other students through the process.
