#### **Our humble beginnings**
Horizon Primary School (HRPS) emphasises itself on a continual journey of growth, change and learning with the philosophy that Every Child can be a Leader. On 4 January 2010, the school started with our inaugural 125 students from Primary 1 to Primary 4 with a team of 13 pioneer staff, led by the founding Principal, Mrs. Janet Ang.  In the school’s first phase of development, the pioneers laid a firm foundation for student-centric, values-driven education and the Horizon spirit.

The school was officially opened by Mr. Heng Swee Keat, then Minister of Education, on the auspicious date of 4 October 2012.  The school-wide leadership programme, I-LEAD, based on Stephen R Covey’s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People was developed to nurture students to be effective self-leaders. The school was recognised as a Leader in Me School in 2013 and I-LEAD was awarded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) status in 2014.

#### **Blossoming achievements through the years**
Through the successive leadership of Mrs Grace Leong on 1 Jan 2016, the school, in its second phase of development, takes strength from its initial phase and focuses in developing lifelong learners through the joy of learning and in providing a holistic education anchored on strong values.  In 2017, the school has a student enrolment close to 1600 and a staff strength of 127. 

Co-Curriculum Activities (CCAs) are weaved into the school hours since 2017 to allow all Primary 3 to 6 students to experience platforms for both character and leadership development and to deepen their interests and skill set.  Another milestone effort towards holistic education, is the Computational Thinking in Mathematics programme which gained the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) status in 2018. It provides students with opportunities to learn and develop mathematical and computational thinking and dispositions such as persistence and resilience through block-based programming. The programme also provides students with the opportunity to practise the 7 habits™ as they develop their problem-solving and communication skills, ability to collaborate in teams, creativity and logical thinking.

Our LLP is refined and being integrated into the core curriculum, allowing our I-LEAD+ to be our customised Character and Citizenship (CCE) curriculum with the continual emphasis on student leadership. This change brings upon a school-wide pervasive inculcation of self-leadership for all students and the tiered leadership platforms are fine-tuned to provide different avenues for students to be leaders for others.  

In 2018, the school is slated for PERI upgrading.  Moving in tandem with the physical change, Horizon Primary will continue to provide a well-rounded education in a joyful learning environment to prepare our Horizon Stars to optimise the learning opportunities presented to them.  As part of MOE’s efforts to improve the quality of pre-school education and Kindergarten care services, Horizon Primary will operate a MOE Kindergarten as well as Kindergarten care services in 2020 to serve the Punggol community.

#### **Partnerships**
The Parent Connect! – the school’s parent support group - was established in 2011 and is going strong with dedicated parents who volunteer their time and efforts to support school’s programme and initiatives and execute large scale school-community events such as Horizon Family Day.
