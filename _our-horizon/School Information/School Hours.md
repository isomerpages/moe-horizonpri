For the safety and security of students and staff, visitors to the school are required to enter the school at&nbsp;**Gate A**&nbsp;and sign in at the security post with a photo ID as proof of identity. Visitors will be issued with a pass which they will have to wear at all times while in the school. Visitors’ movements are restricted to the General Office and the ground level non-teaching areas, e.g. the book shop and dental clinic.
