Horizon is our school where we<br>
Learn values and truths, 

To be compassionate, and be respectful, <br>
To have integrity in all we do. 

We may come from many places <br>
And have different beliefs in life, 

But like the sun’s rays in the Horizon <br>
We will shine brightly in the skies! 

Where a new day dawns! Horizon! <br>
We are where new light begins! 

We’re leaders of our own lives and <br>
Horizon Stars are we! <br>
Horizon Stars are we! 

Horizon’s where we learn with joy <br>
Confident in all we do. 

With trust and love; we strive for excellence; <br>
And be responsible in all we do. 

We may come from many places <br>
And have different beliefs in life, 

But like the sun’s rays in the Horizon <br>
We begin our walk with pride! 

Where a new day dawns! Horizon! <br>
We are where new light begins! 

We’re leaders of our own lives and <br>
Horizon Stars are we! <br>
Horizon Stars are we!
