### **School House System**
#### **Rationale**
The House System aims to:

*   inculcate in students the school values through a structured approach
*   provide a platform for students&nbsp;and staff to develop as leaders and mentors
*   create a joyful learning environment for students&nbsp;and staff by:    
\-   fostering a greater sense of loyalty and pride in students&nbsp;and staff towards the school and the House they belong to<br>
\-   building better teacher-student&nbsp;relationships and student-student&nbsp;friendships<br>
\-   promoting team spirit and sense of identity

#### **Background**
The House System of Horizon is built on the belief of creating a joyful learning environment for our students. Through students' participation in various activities, we create meaningful experiences for them so as to build a sense of belonging and a common identity. The House System is named according to the school's values: Respect, Integrity, Compassion, Excellence (R.I.C.E). Every student finds identity with a House which they will stay committed to till graduation.

#### **Inter-house Participation**
Every department plans programmes and activities that allow students to participate and earn points for their respective Houses. Opportunities for students' House participation is planned according to 5 domains:&nbsp;<br>
(1) Cognitive,&nbsp;<br>
(2) Moral,&nbsp;<br>
(3) Physical,&nbsp;<br>
(4) Social, and&nbsp;<br>
(5) Aesthetics.

Through collaboration and interaction with fellow students, fueled by a spirit of excellence, students contribute to earning points for their respective Houses through a host of programmes and activities. While each House works towards the title of a House champion, the spirit behind the students' synergy is to establish a sense of belonging to Horizon.
