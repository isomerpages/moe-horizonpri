### **Principal's Message 2026**



Dear Parents/Guardians,

A warm welcome back to a new school year! I hope the holidays have been a time of rest, joy and meaningful moments with family and friends. As we begin 2026 together, I am filled with gratitude and excitement to see our school community reunited, ready for a fresh chapter of learning and growth.

This year, our school theme is **“Curious Minds, Caring Hearts.”** This theme reflects our deep commitment to nurturing students who are confident learners, deep thinkers and responsible individuals. In a world that is constantly changing, these qualities are more important than ever.

To have **curious minds** means approaching learning with enthusiasm and wonder. It is about asking questions, exploring possibilities with openness, and having the courage to think beyond the familiar. In our classrooms and learning spaces, students will be encouraged to inquire, to make connections, and to see challenges not as obstacles, but as opportunities to grow. When curiosity is nurtured, learning becomes meaningful, purposeful and joyful. We want our students to be resilient learners who persevere, reflect and continue striving even when the journey is not easy.

At the same time, we believe strongly in nurturing **caring hearts**. Academic success alone is not enough; it must be accompanied by strong values and a sense of responsibility towards others. As a school, we strive to instil in our students the values of kindness, respect and responsibility. These values guide how our students treat one another, how they work with their teachers, and how they contribute to their families, community and nation. A caring heart allows our students to act with empathy, to stand up for what is right, and to make positive choices that benefit the wider community.

None of this is possible without the strong partnership between home and school. I would like to thank our parents for your continued trust and support, and our dedicated staff for their unwavering commitment to every child’s growth and well-being. Together, we create an environment where every child is known, valued and encouraged to be the best version of themselves.

As we step into 2026, there will undoubtedly be new challenges, but there will also be new opportunities to learn, to connect and to grow together. Let us face the year ahead with optimism and hope, confidence that with curious minds and caring hearts, our students will be well-prepared to navigate the future and make a positive difference in the world.

I wish everyone a fulfilling, purposeful and joyful year ahead.

Yours in Partnership,

Mrs Ong Hui Khim

Principal
