### **Principal's Message**

Dear Parents/Guardians,  

Warmest Greetings!

First and foremost, I would like to thank the past Principal, Mrs Grace Leong, for her leadership and service to the school.  I feel honoured to be given this opportunity to join the Horizon family and build upon the good work of my predecessors who came before me.  It is the hope of my staff and myself to cater to the diverse interests and needs of our students and to realise our school’s vision of **Confident Individuals, Responsible Citizens.**

HRPS is also guided by our school mission to nurture every child to lead their lives responsibly and to contribute with joy. We would like them to be ready for the 21st century as effective communicators, inventive thinkers, digital literates, and life-long learners.  Our school philosophy – Every Child is a Leader builds on our belief that every child is a leader in his/her own rights.  We are committed to inculcate in them the school values of Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence so that they can lead meaningful lives, care for their families and serve our nation with pride and joy!

As COVID-19 restrictions are slowly being lifted nationally, we will also take a cautious and gradual approach towards the resumption of our out-of-school activities.  There will be National School Games, Learning Journeys, Camps and many exciting and enriching experiences. Such learning experiences outside the school often create meaningful and engaging learning for our students, and they develop our students holistically in ways we cannot always create in our classrooms.

  

I would like to also extend my sincere appreciation for the relentless support by yourselves and our stakeholders such as the SAC, Alumni Association and the Punggol community as we develop our children to become the best they can be.  The normalcy and growth within the school would not have been possible without you. 

I look forward to working together with you to safeguard the well-being and the interests of every child, because it truly takes a village to raise a child.

Thank you.

Yours in partnership,

Mrs Ong Hui Khim

Principal
