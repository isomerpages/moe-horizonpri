### **Principal's Message**


Dear Parents/Guardians,

Happy New Year and a warm welcome to another exciting chapter in our school’s journey! 

As we step into this new year, we embrace the theme, "**Exploring Possibilities, Learning Together**". This theme serves as a beacon, guiding us to venture beyond our comfort zones, discover untapped potential, and grow collectively as a vibrant learning community.

Our vision, "**Confident Leaders, Responsible Citizens**", continues to inspire every aspect of our work. Together, we strive to nurture each student's unique strengths, empowering them to lead with courage and contribute meaningfully to society. It is this shared vision that unites us—students, teachers, parents, and community partners—to build a school environment where every individual thrives.

Our school has been embracing the 7 Habits of the Leader in Me framework. This year, let us continue to embody these principles as we work towards personal and collective excellence. Be proactive in seizing new opportunities, begin with the end in mind by setting clear goals, and put first things first by prioritizing what truly matters. Let us seek to understand one another, synergize as a community, and sharpen the saw by balancing the dimensions of our well-being—body, mind, heart, and spirit.

Hope and collaboration will be the cornerstones of this year’s success. Together, we can create a school culture where everyone feels valued and supported. Parents, your partnership is invaluable as we work hand in hand to nurture your children’s growth and unlock their full potential.  We encourage our students to embrace self-leadership, taking charge of their actions and choices, as the first step towards becoming leaders who bring about positive outcomes and meaningful impact on society. And you, as our closest partners, your contributions help us pave the way for a brighter future and shaping a future of confident leaders and responsible citizens.

Wishing everyone a year of hope, discovery, and success.

Yours in Partnership,

Mrs Ong Hui Khim

Principal
