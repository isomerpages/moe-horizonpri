### **Principal's Message**


Dear Parents/Guardians,

Warmest Greetings!

I am filled with excitement as we gear up for the start of a new academic year at Horizon Primary School and MK@Horizon!  It is my great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to our returning students and families and extend an equally warm greeting to those joining our school community for the first time.

This year holds a special significance for all of us as we commemorate a remarkable milestone in the history of our beloved institution – **the 15th Anniversary of Horizon Primary School!**

The theme of this celebration, “**Leading with Hearts, Serving with Purpose**”, sums up our collective efforts of our dedicated educators, supportive parents and stakeholders, and talented students in creating a nurturing and inspiring learning environment of our school. Together, we have witnessed countless accomplishments, both big and small, to provide an engaging and enriching educational experience that empowers each student to be **Confident Individuals and Responsible Citizens**.

Throughout this year, we will be organizing various events and activities to mark our 15th Anniversary, one of which is our Junior Olympic Games in Term 2.  These celebrations will provide opportunities for our community to come together, reminisce about the past, and look forward to the promising future that lies ahead.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to our entire school community for your continued support and dedication.  Together, we will make this year a memorable and successful one.

Wishing everyone a fantastic start to the new school year!

Yours in partnership,  
Mrs Ong Hui Khim  
Principal
