<p>"To role model the right values and behaviours in our students, MOE will
place greater emphasis on the expected conduct of parents when interacting
with school staff, and the importance of mutual courtesy and respect. MOE
will ensure a safe work environment for staff to thrive in and will take
firm action against individuals who engage in any form of harassment or
abuse towards our staff. These are encapsulated in MOE's Engagement Charter.&nbsp;"</p>
